<h1 id="introduction-to-">Introduction to ERP.net Web Client</h1>

<p>The ERP.net Web Client is the web-based user interface of the ERP.net business-management platform. It is one of the primary ways to access and interact with all the modules inside the ERP.net system—such as CRM, financials, inventory, production, and more.</p>

By automating routine and repetitive tasks, teams can focus on higher-value activities—boosting productivity and supporting better, faster business decisions.</p>
