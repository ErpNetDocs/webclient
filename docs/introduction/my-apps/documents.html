<h1 id="documents">Documents</h1>

<p><strong>My Documents</strong> is an application dedicated to organizing all documents in ERP.net which <strong>you are somehow involved with</strong>.</p>
<p>These could be the ones you created and assigned to yourself, along with those which your colleagues created and assigned to you afterwards.</p>
<p>Apart from offering <strong>instant access</strong> to each document, the application gives you various ways of <strong>customizing</strong> how they are displayed.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_navigation_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>You no longer need to search across different modules and dozens of system navigators in order to find the document that you need.</p>
<p>In <strong>My Documents</strong>, they are all conveniently <strong>unified</strong> in one place.</p>
<h3 id="important-prerequisites">Important prerequisites</h3>
<p>Upon creation, all ERP.net documents have an <strong>Assigned To User</strong> field that determines the person whose personalized environment they appear in.</p>
<p>By default, new documents are automatically assigned to the <strong>person creating them</strong> (e.g. you).
You also have the option to assign them to <strong>someone else</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/assignedtouser.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Currently, you always provide the <strong>login</strong> of the user (as defined in <strong>Setup -&gt; Security -&gt; Users</strong>), and not their actual name.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> If the <strong>Assigned To User</strong> field is not visible, you need to reveal it manually by <strong>customizing</strong> the document creation panel.
This will enable you to change the <strong>person</strong> the document is assigned to.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Once a user is specified and the document is saved, it will appear in the user's respective <strong>My Documents</strong> environment.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>You can take advantage of various <strong>buttons</strong>, <strong>fields</strong>, <strong>customization features</strong>, and <strong>menus</strong> to better navigate and organize your documents.</p>
<h3 id="documents-table">Documents table</h3>
<p>At the very center of <strong>My Documents</strong> is a table presenting all the documents which are somehow related to your account.</p>
<p>You can not only <strong>preview</strong>, but also <strong>interact</strong> with this table, starting from simple operations, such as <strong>filtering</strong>, <strong>sorting</strong>, and <strong>accessing</strong> your documents.</p>
<p>The app also empowers users to go to more advanced options like grouping documents by <strong>column headers</strong> and displaying <strong>summarized data</strong> about the documents.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_documents_selected_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>The <strong>search bar</strong> above the table is intended to help you find a specific document.</p>
<p>Simply provide a detail related to it, like its <strong>number</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, or the <strong>type of document</strong> you are looking for - a meeting, appointment, offer, sales order, etc.</p>
<p>The search will return a list of all the documents that contain the <strong>detail you searched for</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_search_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<h3 id="actions-menu">Actions menu</h3>
<p>You can click the vertical <strong>three-dot button</strong> to expand a menu containing a list of <strong>actions</strong>.</p>
<p>It allows you to perform a wide variety of operations, such as <strong>reloading</strong> your records, <strong>exporting</strong> the table with its data, and even <strong>grouping</strong> your documents by one or more parameters.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_panel_menu_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<h2 id="show-grouping-panel">Show grouping panel</h2>
<p>You can use the <strong>Show grouping panel</strong> feature to arrange your documents in groups based on a certain <strong>parameter</strong>, visualized by its respective <strong>column header</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, you may want to separate the full list of your existing documents into several groups.
These groups could organize documents by <strong>their type</strong>, <strong>their state</strong>, <strong>the month</strong> they were created on, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_grouping_panel_Drag_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>To begin, click on <strong>Show grouping panel</strong>, then <strong>drag and drop</strong> a column header right into the field (the space) that appeared above the table.</p>
<p>Once you do that, the documents will be arranged in groups based on that column (e.g. Document Type).</p>
<p>Documents having the same value in the column header you grouped by will appear under the same group.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_grouping_panel_type_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>You can also group your documents in a multi-level, hierarchical order by providing <strong>multiple column headers</strong>.</p>
<p>In that case, the documents will be further categorized in groups based on the column that goes first, followed by the rest of the grouped columns in a consecutive order.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_grouping_panel_multiple_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>By adding more groups, you configure the table to visualize the documents in a more structured and navigation friendly way.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you add a <strong>Document Type</strong> column header first, then a <strong>Document Date</strong> column header second:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Two levels</strong> of groups will show up.</li>
<li>The <strong>first-level groups</strong> will indicate what <strong>type of documents</strong> each of them contains - for example, activities, offers, sales orders, etc.</li>
<li>While the <strong>second-level groups</strong> will further narrow the range of documents down to <strong>the date</strong> they were issued on - for example, only the offers issued for a specific year, month, or date.</li>
</ol>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can gain insight into your data from different points of view by changing what column headers you group or even just by switching their order.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="panel-customization">Panel customization</h2>
<p>Like most <strong>My</strong> apps, the <strong>Documents</strong> application can be freely customized to your preferences.</p>
<p>Simply go to the band with the &quot;Documents&quot; title at the top of the table panel and click the <strong>Customize panel</strong> option from the <strong>three-dot</strong> actions menu. This will open a window with two tabs:</p>
<p><strong>Items</strong></p>
<p>You can <strong>hide</strong> or <strong>reveal</strong> columns in the documents table from the <strong>System</strong> section of this tab.</p>
<p>Toggle the <strong>slider</strong> button next to the desired column to trigger the respective action.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_customize_system_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p><strong>Reorder</strong></p>
<p>You can <strong>change</strong> the order of the table column headers to better fit your preferences.</p>
<p>Drag them up and down until they form the desired sequence.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_Customize_panel_Reorder_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You can also reorder your columns by dragging and dropping them horizontally across the table itself.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="menu">Menu</h2>
<p>There's an additional Menu <strong>button</strong> in the ribbon that allows you to interact with the entire <strong>My Documents</strong> application.</p>
<p>You can take advantage of more global features, such as opening <strong>side panels</strong>, adding <strong>widgets</strong>, creating different <strong>tiles</strong>, and showing them <strong>multiple times</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_menu_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<h3 id="side-panels">Side panels</h3>
<p>These can provide invaluable information for each of your documents, as well as allow you to apply additional <strong>filters</strong> to the table.</p>
<p>For instance, you can show the <strong>Details</strong> panel to view additional information about each of your documents.</p>
<p>This enables you to preview the document's data in a fast and easy way, without even having to open the document's form.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>The Details panel will visualize the data of a document as soon as you select its row.<br>
You can <strong>rapidly preview</strong> the data of a number of documents - simply <strong>switch between the rows</strong> of the primary table when ready.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_details_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>Oftentimes, a document is issued as part of a sequence of documents, called a document chain.</p>
<p>Having the <strong>Document flow</strong> panel at your disposal gives you an easy way to traverse the whole document chain and quickly access all documents related to the current one.</p>
<p>If a document is released as part of other documents, the entire chain will show up here.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_document_flow_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<h3 id="tiles">Tiles</h3>
<p>You can save a specific configuration of the <strong>My documents</strong> page and create a <strong>tile</strong> for it.</p>
<p>In case you have set a combination of filters, the tile will store them as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you visit your personalized <strong><a href="https://docs.erp.net/webclient/introduction/my-apps/tiles.html">Tiles</a></strong> environment, the respective <strong>Documents</strong> tile will be available to access directly from there.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_widgets_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<h3 id="customize-form">Customize form</h3>
<p>Last but not least, you can <strong>customize</strong> the look and feel of your <strong>Documents</strong> application.</p>
<p>Simply select <strong>Customize form</strong> from the <strong>Menu</strong> button's dropdown.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_menu_customize_form_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>A window with two tabs will open:</p>
<p><strong>Items</strong></p>
<p>Here, you can <strong>hide</strong> or <strong>reveal</strong> certain panels, widgets, and items from the main page.</p>
<p>Toggle their sliders <strong>off</strong> or <strong>on</strong>, respectively, to achieve the desired action.</p>
<p>It is here that you can also include additional widget panels dedicated to your <strong>favorite</strong> documents, document-related <strong>tiles</strong>, and different <strong>web views</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_add_widgets_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>You can include up to <strong>five</strong> tile panels in your <strong>Documents</strong> application.</p>
<p>This allows you to have readily available configurations which can <strong>alter</strong> the appearance of the page when clicked, based on the filters and grouping configurations applied.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_show_multiple_times_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p><strong>Reorder</strong></p>
<p>You can change the order of the items on the page by dragging them up and down until they form the desired layout.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/Documents_menu_reorder_07_02.png" alt="Pictures"></p>
<p>Use the <strong>Position</strong> option to determine how each of the item panels you want to visualize.</p>
<p>You can select between a <strong>Fill</strong>, <strong>Left</strong>, or <strong>Right</strong> position to neatly order your panels and make the best use of your screen space.</p>
