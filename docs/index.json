They prioritize essential steps by leaving out those the user may want to easily skip. Whether it is for fields or panels, enter stops allow for faster and more intuitive management of pages. Unlike the tab key, which always goes through each and every field and panel, the Enter key’s usage can be customized . When editing the document, if enter stops are configured and you are pressing the enter key when you are done editing a field, some fields will be skipped and the cursor will automatically move from one important field to another. Setting enter stops with data fields In Edit mode, you can choose which data fields work with enter stops by clicking the Settings icon at the top right corner of a document. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab. Take a note of the boxes under Enter Stop . During editing, fields with checkmarks are prioritized while empty ones are skipped . This setting won’t delete them from the database. Select the ones you will more likely need to fill out every time you create a sales order, and close the window. Setting enter stops with panels Further to individual fields, you can also choose which entire panels should be skipped and which ones should be prioritized. You can configure this behavior by clicking the Settings icon at the Panels section. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab again, select which panels should be considered enter stops, and close the window. The ones without the checkbox will be skipped when pressing the enter key while editing the document. Using enter stops To put the changes you’ve made into practice, simply press the Enter key while editing a document. Doing this again moves the blue highlights from one prioritized field to the next. The highlighted path follows the fields with checkmarks in a chronological order. In this case, the user starts with “Customer” and goes directly to “From Party”, skipping \"Access Key\". Enter stops can be applied not only to fields but also to icons and buttons such as Next and Create New , this way significantly speeding up the editing process compared to only click-based programs."

    "keywords": "How to filter by (me), (current), and (empty) You can use filtering expressions for applicable attributes to narrow down the scope of what is displayed in a particular navigator. They are specified in the filter row found under some columns of the respective navigator as well as in the Advanced filter panel using the contains operator. If the filtering row is not visible, you can enable it through the panel's menu or by clicking on the filter icon on the far-left of the columns. Example: Within the Orders panel of the Sales module, you input \" (me) \" in the filtering row of the Assigned To User column. This results in only documents assigned to you to be displayed in the table. Rules and syntax Filtering expressions follow a fixed syntax that can influence the outcome they produce. It's therefore crucial to write them down exactly as they are and in the correct filtering rows if you want to achieve the desired effect. (current) and (empty) These expressions enable you to conveniently locate documents associated with your enterprise company and its location . (current) makes the table display only the items linked to the enterprise company and/or location you're currently logged into. (empty) makes the table reveal items that are not strictly tied to any enterprise company and/or location. Example: Input \"(current)\" into the filtering row of the Enterprise Company column. Only items associated with the company you're currently involved with will be displayed in the table. (me) This expression enables you to locate only the documents assigned to you. Example: Input \"(me)\" into the filtering row of the Assigned To User column. Only items assigned to the user you're logged in as will be displayed in the table. Note When you input expressions in filtering rows, popup suggestions will appear to speed up the writing process. Multiple filtering expressions You can apply more than one filtering expression at a time. This way, your navigator could visualize items that are assigned to you and match both your current enterprise company and its location. It's also possible to place multiple expressions within the same filtering row with the “ or ” operator. As a result, the table will display items that meet all of these conditions. Using tiles with filtering expressions When you apply one or more expressions to a navigator, you can create a tile for it in order to save its current filtering configuration. Regardless of how the table changes later, tiles allow you to easily access a previous \"snapshot\" of it when it had different filters applied. Example: Filter a navigator to display only the items assigned to you. Then, create a tile for it, naming it “Orders assigned to me”. When you save your tile, you will be able to access it from within the Tiles app in the My module."

If the filtering row is not visible, you can enable it through the panel's menu or by clicking on the filter icon on the far-left of the columns.

This results in only items created on the current date to be displayed in the table. Rules and syntax Period expressions follow a fixed syntax that can influence the outcome they produce. It's therefore crucial to write them down exactly as they are if you want to achieve the desired effect. Relative time expressions These expressions are word-based and surrounded by brackets . You can use them to define specific dates or broader date ranges which are always relative to the current one. Examples include \" (yesterday) \" and \" (last month) \". They always take into consideration today as a reference point. While (yesterday) will list results only from the date before today, (last month) will show results from across the entire month previous to the current one. Here's a list of relative time expressions: Expression Begin End Notes (today) 2023-11-27 2023-11-27 (yesterday) 2023-11-26 2023-11-26 (last month) 2023-10-01 2023-10-31 (this month) 2023-11-01 2023-11-30 (next month) 2023-12-01 2023-12-31 (last year) 2022-01-01 2022-12-31 (this year) 2023-01-01 2023-12-31 (next year) 2024-01-01 2024-12-31 (ytd) 2023-01-01 2023-11-27 Year-to-date (jan) 2023-01-01 2023-01-31 (jan last year) 2022-01-01 2022-01-31 Relative period expressions These expressions consist of symbols , numbers and letters and can be used in two ways: Without brackets If a period expression is used without brackets, it limits the scope of a table's records to only the ones created on specific dates relative to the current one. For example, \" -7d \" denotes the date exactly seven days before the current one, while \" +2d \" represents a date exactly two days ahead of the current one. Similarly, \" -1m \" indicates the date exactly one month before the current date, while \" +1y \" denotes the date exactly a year after the current one. To see records only for today , you can specify \" 0 \". Even if you add \"+\" or \"-\" before \"0\" or any letter after \"0\", the final effect will be the same. With brackets If surrounded by brackets, relative period expressions can be used to specify rounded calendar periods relative to the present moment. For example, \" (-1m) \" denotes the entire month that was before the current month, while \" (+1y) \" represents the entire year that follows the current one. To see records only for the duration of the current month , you can specify \" (0m) \". Even if you add \"+\" or \"-\" before \"0m\", the final effect will be the same. Warning \"0\" specified without brackets represents the current date regardless of whether it's used as a beginning or end. If no indicating letter is specified next to a number, the default convention is days , e.g. \"-7\" is equivalent to \"-7d\" and \"0\" represents today. When specifying a period in days , it can be written with or without brackets, e.g. \"-7\" is equivalent to \"(-7)\". Expression Begin End Notes 0m 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today +0m 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today -0m 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today -0d 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today -0y 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today 0 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today Expressions for quarters and half years These expressions establish specific intervals within a broader timeframe. For example, \" q1 \" points to the entire first quarter of the year, \" q2 \" represents the second quarter, and \" h1 \" denotes the first half of the year. Custom time periods You can set custom time periods to fit the results of a table into a specific timeframe. This is achieved by adding \" .. \" between two period expressions or fixed dates. For instance, \" (feb)..(today) \" represents the entire time period spanning from the beginning of February up until and including the current date. Similarly, \" (yesterday)..+2d \" starts from yesterday and includes the two dates following the current date. If there is no notation before or after \"..\", it implies infinity . Thus, \"..(last month)\" would result in a navigator showing all existing records up until the final day of the last month. Note The screenshots taken for this article are from v24 of the platform."

When issuing a return of a product, for instance, you may want to request the original price but not the birth date of a client. Depending on its use-case, an object category can represent one or more types - Customer Type, Asset Type and Document Type. Thus, it's possible to start creating a document or an entity with an object category already selected for it.

We'll skip the description of the trivial calendar functionality- how you can navigate between the months, how the today's date is marked, etc... We'll just show you the essentials. Activities This is the main goal of the calendar in the ERP.net Web Client. It will show in a convenient way all your activities. This way you can see them in a convenient, natural way, without the need to open navigators, apply filters, etc. Also you can create a new activity. Just click on the \"Create\" button: Fill in the required fields, save it and you're done. The new activity will appear on the day for which it's planned. View types The calendar app supports different view types. You can switch between them from the app's panel settings. When you choose the new type of view, the changes will take effect immediately. Monthly The default view type. Self-explanatory, shows the days of the selected month, alignining the raster with the days of the previous and next, graying them out. Workweek An alternative view, showing the five days of the selected work week as columns. The working time will be visualized on the vertical axis. Smart responsiveness Why smart? Because it doesn't just scale to the size of your screen, but it takes into account how you really could use it, according the size of your screen. If your screen doesn't show a large area (e.g., your mobile), then the so-called responsiveness comes. That's the monthly view on a mobile. Yes, it's not just scaled, it's a different layout to fit your needs. The activities are shown as \"dots\" and now you have agenda. Click (more specifically \"touch\") on a day and the agenda will show your activities as a list. Additionally, you may notice that the calendar's toolbar is refactored. Now you have header and footer toolbars. Mobile touch gestures support Mobile touch gestures are also supported. You can swipe left or right on your screen and as a result, you will move the calendar backward or forward. I am a widget This is not something new for a \"My app\", but rather a key functionality. You can add a calendar wherever you want as a widget panel. My Calendar as an inline control My Calendar is also present as an inline control anywhere in ERP.net Web Client where you need to enter a date. Here's an example when creating a new activity where you need to set the document's date . In addition to date, time input is also supported. The calendar will automatically allow time input when the property you're editing requires it. As in the example from above - when specifying the date and time for a reminder in to do task . Here's what the same control looks like, but in mobile view: Of course, sometimes you only need to enter an exact time. The calendar will adapt and display only the time: Time presets The time seletion in the control is presented as a list of convenient predefined times: 10:00 / Morning 12:30 / Lunch 14:00 / Early afternoon 16:00 / Late afternoon 19:00 / Dinner If you want to set another time, you can do it manually via the input at the bottom. Customizing time presets It's also possible to completely redefine the time presets to suit your needs. This can be done via the global configuration options via the key Calendar/TimePresets . When this key has value, conforming to the format below, it overrides the default time presets. <PresetName1>=<H>:<M>;<PresetName2>=<H>:<M>;... e.g., Morning=10:00;Lunch=12:30;Afternoon=15:00;Dinner=19:00"

    "title": "Documents | ERP.net Web Client",
    "keywords": "Documents My Documents is an application dedicated to organizing all documents in ERP.net which you are somehow involved with . These could be the ones you created and assigned to yourself, along with those which your colleagues created and assigned to you afterwards. Apart from offering instant access to each document, the application gives you various ways of customizing how they are displayed. You no longer need to search across different modules and dozens of system navigators in order to find the document that you need. In My Documents , they are all conveniently united in one place. Important prerequisites Upon creation, all ERP.net documents have an Assigned To User field that determines the person whose personalized environment they appear in. By default, new documents are automatically assigned to the person creating them (e.g. you). You also have the option to assign them to someone else . Note Currently, you always provide the login of the user (as defined in Setup -> Security -> Users ), and not their actual name. If the Assigned To User field is not visible, you need to reveal it manually by customizing the document creation panel. This will enable you to change the person the document is assigned to. Once a user is specified and the document is saved, it will appear in the user's respective My Documents environment. Features You can take advantage of various buttons, fields, customization features, and menus to better navigate and organize your documents. Documents table At the very center of My Documents is a table presenting all the documents which are somehow related to your account. You can not only preview , but also interact with this table, starting from simple operations, such as filtering , sorting , and accessing your documents. The app also empowers users to go to more advanced options like grouping documents by column headers and displaying summarized data about the documents. Search The search bar above the table is intended to help you find a specific document. Simply provide a detail related to it, like its number , date , or the type of document you are looking for - a meeting, appointment, offer, sales order, etc. The search will return a list of all the documents that contain the detail you searched for. Actions menu You can click the vertical three-dot button to expand a menu containing a list of actions . It allows you to perform a wide variety of operations, such as reloading your records, exporting the table with its data, and even grouping your documents by one or more parameters. Show grouping panel You can use the Show grouping panel feature to arrange your documents in groups based on a certain parameter , visualized by its respective column header . For instance, you may want to separate the full list of your existing documents into several groups. These groups could organize documents by their type , state , the month they were created on, and so on. To begin, click on the Show grouping panel , then drag and drop a column header right into the field (space) that appears above the table. Once you do that, the documents will be arranged in groups based on that column (e.g. Document Type). Documents having the same value determined by a column header will appear under it. You can also group your documents in a multi-level, hierarchical order by providing multiple column headers . In that case, the documents will be further categorized in groups based on the column that was placed first, followed by the rest of the grouped columns in a consecutive order. By adding more groups, you configure the table to visualize the documents in a more structured and navigation-friendly way. For example, let's say you add a Document Type column header first, then a Document Date column header second: Two levels of groups will show up. The first-level groups will indicate what type of documents each of them contains - for example, activities, offers, sales orders, etc. The second-level groups will further narrow the range of documents down to the date they were issued on - for example, only the offers issued for a specific year, month, or date. Tip You can gain insights into your data from different points of view by changing the column headers that you group or simply by switching their order. Summary You can gather useful statistical information about each column and use it for operational and analytical purposes by taking advantage of My Documents' Summary feature. Summary allows you to gain an overview of your documents by enabling you to automatically perform arithmetic and logical operations to the list of documents assigned to you. Using Summary, you can find out the number of documents (in a group or in total) containing a specific value in them or the number of documents containing entirely unique values. Simply right-click on a column header and select Summary from the menu. This will open a list of available functions . Count - It calculates the number of documents where a specific value in a field is present. Distinct - It counts all the unique instances of all values within a field in the current navigator form. For fields with a number data type , you can see other details such as Max or Min values. Note The Distinct option sums up the number of values that are present in your documents, taking into account only the first repetition for repetitive values. To illustrate how these options work, imagine the following situation. You want to find out the total number of documents you have in different states. You want to consider how many states you have documents in. Let's say you have three documents in New , one in Firm Planned , and two in Released state. If you use Count on the State column header, the option will display the result of 6. This is the total number of instances where the state value is present in your documents. Using Distinct , however, will total at the number 3, as these are all the distinct states you have documents in. The rest of the values for state are just repetitions of some value that is already present. Panel customization Like most My apps, the Documents application can be freely customized to your preferences. Simply click the Customize panel option from the three-dot actions menu found at the top-right corner of the table. This will open a window with two tabs: Items You can hide or reveal columns in the documents table from the System section of this tab. Toggle the slider button next to the desired column to trigger the respective action. Reorder You can change the order of the table column headers to better fit your preferences. Drag them up and down until they form the desired sequence. Note You can also reorder your columns by dragging and dropping them horizontally across the table itself. Menu There's an additional Menu button in the ribbon above the table that allows you to interact with the entire My Documents application. You can take advantage of more global features, such as opening a document's Details , viewing more Detail panels , adding widgets , creating different tiles , and showing them multiple times . Side panel The panel available in the Side panel section can provide invaluable information for your documents, as well as allow you to apply additional filters to the table. For instance, you can display the Details panel, allowing you to view in-depth information about each of your documents. This enables you to preview the document's data in a fast and easy way, without even having to open the document's form. In addition, you can select some of the Detail panels - these panels carry data related to the primary document you are reviewing. Tip The Details panel and each Detail panel (related to the document currently at view) will visualize data for the respective document as soon as you select its row. You can rapidly preview such data for a number of documents - simply switch between the rows of the primary table when ready. Document flow Oftentimes, a document is issued as part of a sequence of documents, called a document chain . Having the Document flow panel at your disposal gives you an easy way to traverse the whole document chain and quickly access all documents related to the current one. If a document is released as part of other documents, the entire chain will show up here. Tiles You can save a specific configuration of the My documents page and create a tile for it. In case you have set a combination of filters, the tile will store them as well. Whenever you visit your personalized Tiles environment, the respective Documents tile will be available to access directly from there. Customize form Last but not least, you can customize the look and feel of your Documents application. Simply select Customize form from the Menu button's dropdown. A window with two tabs will open: Items Here, you can hide or reveal certain panels, widgets, and items from the main page. Toggle their sliders off or on , respectively, to achieve the desired action. It is here that you can also include additional widget panels dedicated to your favorite documents, document-related tiles , and different web views . You can include up to five tile panels in your Documents application. This allows you to have readily available configurations which can alter the appearance of the page when clicked, based on the filters and grouping configurations applied. Reorder You can change the order of the items on the page by dragging them up and down until they form the desired layout. Use the Position option to determine how each of the item panels you want to visualize. You can select between a Fill , Left , or Right position to neatly order your panels and make the best use of your screen space."
