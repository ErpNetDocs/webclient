They prioritize essential steps by leaving out those the user may want to easily skip. Whether it is for fields or panels, enter stops allow for faster and more intuitive management of pages. Unlike the tab key, which always goes through each and every field and panel, the Enter key’s usage can be customized. When editing the document, if enter stops are configured and you are pressing the enter key when you are done editing a field, some fields will be skipped and the cursor will automatically move from one important field to another. Setting enter stops with data fields In Edit mode, you can choose which data fields work with enter stops by clicking the Settings icon at the top right corner of a document. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab. Take a note of the boxes under Enter Stop . During editing, fields with checkmarks are prioritized while empty ones are skipped . This setting won’t delete them from the database. Select the ones you will more likely need to fill out every time you create a sales order, and close the window. Setting enter stops with panels Further to individual fields, you can also choose which entire panels should be skipped and which ones should be prioritized. You can configure this behavior by clicking the Settings icon at the Panels section. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab again, select which panels should be considered enter stops, and close the window. The ones without the checkbox will be skipped when pressing the enter key while editing the document. Using enter stops To put the changes you’ve made into practice, simply press the Enter key while editing a document. Doing this again moves the blue highlights from one prioritized field to the next. The highlighted path follows the fields with checkmarks in a chronological order. In this case, the user starts with “Customer” and goes directly to “From Party”, skipping \"Access Key\". Enter stops can be applied not only to fields but also to icons and buttons such as Next and Create New , this way significantly speeding up the editing process compared to only click-based programs."

By default, whenever owners create a new activity, their related entities have it automatically added in their personal calendars. The same logic can be applied to an activity's participants . Process Any user can view and access a task, meeting, or other forms of activities they're scheduled to take part in. However, they must first be defined as participants on the platform. Make sure your participant is registered as such on the General -> Contacts -> Participants module. If not, create a new one from scratch by providing all necessary information. Create a new activity directly from My Calendar or from the General -> Contacts -> Activities module. If the Participants panel is absent, enable it through the Show/Hide panels button. When you add the user(s), finish the creation of the activity. Participants will now be able to see and access it from within their own personal calendars. Note!

We'll skip the description of the trivial calendar functionality- how you can navigate between the months, how the today's date is marked, etc... We'll just show you the essentials. Activities This is the main goal of the calendar in the ERP.net Web Client. It will show in a convenient way all your activities. This way you can see them in a convenient, natural way, without the need to open navigators, apply filters, etc. Also you can create a new activity. Just click on the \"Create\" button: Fill in the required fields, save it and you're done. The new activity will appear on the day for which it's planned. View types The calendar app supports different view types. You can switch between them from the app's panel settings. When you choose the new type of view, the changes will take effect immediately. Monthly The default view type. Self-explanatory, shows the days of the selected month, alignining the raster with the days of the previous and next, graying them out. Workweek An alternative view, showing the five days of the selected work week as columns. The working time will be visualized on the vertical axis. Smart responsiveness Why smart? Because it doesn't just scale to the size of your screen, but it takes into account how you really could use it, according the size of your screen. If your screen doesn't show a large area (e.g., your mobile), then the so-called responsiveness comes. That's the monthly view on a mobile. Yes, it's not just scaled, it's a different layout to fit your needs. The activities are shown as \"dots\" and now you have agenda. Click (more specifically \"touch\") on a day and the agenda will show your activities as a list. Additionally, you may notice that the calendar's toolbar is refactored. Now you have header and footer toolbars. Mobile touch gestures support Mobile touch gestures are also supported. You can swipe left or right on your screen and as a result, you will move the calendar backward or forward. I am a widget This is not something new for a \"My app\", but rather a key functionality. You can add a calendar wherever you want as a widget panel. My Calendar as an inline control My Calendar is also present as an inline control anywhere in ERP.net Web Client where you need to enter a date. Here's an example when creating a new activity where you need to set the document's date . In addition to date, time input is also supported. The calendar will automatically allow time input when the property you're editing requires it. As in the example from above - when specifying the date and time for a reminder in to do task . Here's what the same control looks like, but in mobile view: Of course, sometimes you only need to enter an exact time. The calendar will adapt and display only the time: Time presets The time seletion in the control is presented as a list of convenient predefined times: 10:00 / Morning 12:30 / Lunch 14:00 / Early afternoon 16:00 / Late afternoon 19:00 / Dinner If you want to set another time, you can do it manually via the input at the bottom. Customizing time presets It's also possible to completely redefine the time presets to suit your needs. This can be done via the global configuration options via the key Calendar/TimePresets . When this key has value, conforming to the format below, it overrides the default time presets. <PresetName1>=<H>:<M>;<PresetName2>=<H>:<M>;... e.g., Morning=10:00;Lunch=12:30;Afternoon=15:00;Dinner=19:00"

Example Different document forms will prioritise certain fields over others. When issuing a return of a product, for instance, you may want to request the original price but not the birth date of a client. Depending on its use-case, an object category can represent one or more types - Customer Type, Asset Type and Document Type. Thus, it's possible to start creating a document or an entity with an object category already selected for it. Here's a list of data types and supported object categories: Applications / Asset Мanagement: Managed Asset - Managed Asset Type Applications / Rental: Asset - Asset Type Applications / Service: Service Object - Service Object Type CRM / Common: Customer - Customer Type Finance / Assets: Asset - Asset Category General / Common: Parties - Party Type (exception, because it is an Entity Type specifier) General / Common: Document - Document Type (exception, because documents are also separated by leaf entity type) General / Products: Products - Product Type Logistics / Common: Logistic Units - Logistic Unit Type Logistics / Procurement: Supplier - Supplier Type Process You need to have at least one type of a document. For example, the Create section of the Orders panel may offer a direct sales order, a POS sales order, a standard sales order, and more. If the available options are not what you're looking for, you can manually add custom document types. This is typically done with the circular plus button found on the respective panel. Click a document type visualized on the main panel (e.g. Direct Sale Order) This will take you to the creation form of the document where an object category is already applied. Keep in mind that the field will be read-only and unable to be changed. Customize the view of the form through the Show/hide fields window. This allows you to enable or disable specific fields. Clicking outside the window once will save the view for the current document, but the settings will be reset for another document.

This option grants different permissions and responsibilities based on an employee’s workplace and department. However, the roles you’re allowed to define will vary . When companies are matched with locations, you can choose only the most suitable entries per combination. By default, users without predefined enterprise company and company location have role access to all of them. Prerequisites Make sure the Roles panel is part of the user’s standard settings definition. Open the list of default panel and toggle the Roles slider. This will add the panel to the user’s settings and allow you to define and change custom roles. Role definition In the Roles panel, you can link one or more roles to a user. Their scope can be configured to cover that user’s enterprise company and company location. Enter Edit Mode to be able to change settings. Navigate to the Roles panel and click the plus button to add a new role. Within the expanded side tab on the right, choose values for the Role , Enterprise Company and Company Location fields.

    "keywords": "Picking routes Workers who physically pick items for the warehouse orders use picking routes to guide them through the process. The route is calculated using the \"Suggest warehouse locations\" function that is available in the Orders menu of WMS worker. The picking route takes into account the different parameters that are set up for the warehouse, such as: The Zones specified as picking zones through the \"Zone Type\" policy; The Locations addresses that are used to calculate the best route through the warehouse; as well as other factors, such as: the availability in the different locations – suggests the location with the smallest availability that is enough to fulfill the order; and the lot’s Expiry Date. Note The Pick task type is not yet supported by the system. Is is replaced by the Dispatch task type, which directly issues the product from the Warehousе. Currently, the function can only be used for dispatch Warehouse Orders i.e. Warehouse Orders whose lines are only with Dispatch or Comp-dispatch task type. How to use it? Open the Orders menu of WMS Worker. This takes you to a list of the orders that are available for execution for the current worker. Click on the outbound order you would like to execute. This will open a screen containing the lines of the order and their details. At the bottom of the screen, you will find a three-dot button, from which you can access the Suggest Warehouse Locations function: This will start the processing of the lines and the calculation of the function. When the processing is done, the function will load all Locations that were successfully determined in the Loc column and will automatically sort the lines ascending by the location's address. This will form the route that the worker needs to follow to sequentially collect all products from the order. The worker can start following the route by clicking the Execute button. This will display the first screen which contains the information about the suggested Location and will lead the worker to it. When the worker reaches the Location, he has to scan the Location and perform the rest of the line execution as usual. Once the execution of the first line is finished, the system will bring the worker back to the lines menu and will automatically select the next line that is available for execution and by this, will lead the worker to the next Location of the route. What if the function could not suggest a location for all lines? The order lines for which the system could not find a suitable Location to suggest will be sorted last - after all lines with successfully suggested locations. This way, when the worker finishes following the suggested route, he can still execute the remaining lines without suggestions. The system will not guide the worker to a particular location, but the Location screen during the line execution contains provides convenient panels e.g. the Availability panel, which the worker can use to find a location from where he can still pick the product."
