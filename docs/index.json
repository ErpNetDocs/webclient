    "keywords": "Enter stops Enter stops can be used to speed up the process of creating and editing data fields. They prioritize essential steps by leaving out those the user may want to easily skip. Whether it is for fields or panels, enter stops allow for faster and more intuitive management of pages. Unlike the tab key, which always goes through each and every field and panel, the Enter key’s usage can be customized. When editing the document, if enter stops are configured and you are pressing the enter key when you are done editing a field, some fields will be skipped and the cursor will automatically move from one important field to another. Setting enter stops with data fields In Edit mode, you can choose which data fields work with enter stops by clicking the Settings icon at the top right corner of a document. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab. Take a note of the boxes under Enter Stop . During editing, fields with checkmarks are prioritized while empty ones are skipped . This setting won’t delete them from the database. Select the ones you will more likely need to fill out every time you create a sales order, and close the window. Setting enter stops with panels Further to individual fields, you can also choose which entire panels should be skipped and which ones should be prioritized. You can configure this behavior by clicking the Settings icon at the Panels section. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab again, select which panels should be considered enter stops, and close the window. The ones without the checkbox will be skipped when pressing the enter key while editing the document. Using enter stops To put the changes you’ve made into practice, simply press the Enter key while editing a document. Doing this again moves the blue highlights from one prioritized field to the next. The highlighted path follows the fields with checkmarks in a chronological order. In this case, the user starts with “Customer” and goes directly to “From Party”, skipping \"Access Key\". Enter stops can be applied not only to fields but also to icons and buttons such as Next and Create New , this way significantly speeding up the editing process compared to only click-based programs."

We'll skip the description of the trivial calendar functionality- how you can navigate between the months, how the today's date is marked, etc... We'll just show you the essentials. Activities This is the main goal of the calendar in the ERP.net Web Client. It will show in a convenient way all your activities. This way you can see them in a convenient, natural way, without the need to open navigators, apply filters, etc. Also you can create a new activity. Just click on the \"Create\" button: Fill in the required fields, save it and you're done. The new activity will appear on the day for which it's planned. View types The calendar app supports different view types. You can switch between them from the app's panel settings. When you choose the new type of view, the changes will take effect immediately. Monthly The default view type. Self-explanatory, shows the days of the selected month, alignining the raster with the days of the previous and next, graying them out. Workweek An alternative view, showing the five days of the selected work week as columns. The working time will be visualized on the vertical axis. Smart responsiveness Why smart? Because it doesn't just scale to the size of your screen, but it takes into account how you really could use it, according the size of your screen. If your screen doesn't show a large area (e.g., your mobile), then the so-called responsiveness comes. That's the monthly view on a mobile. Yes, it's not just scaled, it's a different layout to fit your needs. The activities are shown as \"dots\" and now you have agenda. Click (more specifically \"touch\") on a day and the agenda will show your activities as a list. Additionally, you may notice that the calendar's toolbar is refactored. Now you have header and footer toolbars. Mobile touch gestures support Mobile touch gestures are also supported. You can swipe left or right on your screen and as a result, you will move the calendar backward or forward. I am a widget This is not something new for a \"My app\", but rather a key functionality. You can add a calendar wherever you want as a widget panel."

These are interactive applications that can \"live independently\"- i.e., you can use them as standalone apps. In most cases, they present aggregated or more complex data in a convenient way. My apps are directly related and are also a key extension of the Social ERP concept . They can be accessed through their section in the main menu. A classic example of one \"My app\" is the calendar. It's a standalone application that visualizes a calendar, taking up the entire page. Of course, this is not just a calendar :) You can read more about it in the separate topic . Widgets A specific feature of each \"My app\" is that it can be visualized not only independently, as given above, but also in its own panel . Note Panels that host My apps are called widget panels or simply widgets. So what do you think you can do with widget panels? You can visualize them anywhere . Yes, literally everywhere. In any form in ERP.net Web Client. What's more, they are smart - i.e. they take into account the context in which they are displayed and show only relevant content. See, for example, My Tiles . How much information it displays in its main screen: And see now what it visualizes if placed in Crm -> Common: Or even more specifically - Crm -> Common -> Price Lists: This is the idea - contextual information at your fingertips, easily accessible anywhere. Visualizing a widget panel Just go to the form where you want to add it. From the main settings, click \"Show/Hide panels\". Expand the \"Widget Panels\" category and just check the ones you want to include. Done. The widgets in the example were calendar and tiles . You can find more information about them, as well as all other widgets, through the menu section on the left."

All products or all products in a specific group, etc... A sample view of the tiles app. Tile Each tile is a simple piece of data. It shows just two things- a caption and a number. The title is user-defined, and the number represents the objects count. Internally, each tile represents an entity (i.e. a repository) and the number it shows is the number of objects in it. As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are several tiles representing the same navigator, but the number of objects they show is different. The difference is that some have applied filters. This is just the Customers navigator, but with an applied filter. FromDate >= \"2019-01-01\" and FromDate <= \"2020-01-01\" Additionally, each tile is a link to its navigator with an applied filter (if any). This means that you just need to click it and its corresponding filtered navigator will open. Creating a tile You can follow the steps below to create a tile: Open a navigator of your choice. If you want some filtering, just apply it. Then open the form's main menu and select \"Create a new tile\". A dialog will open where you can enter the caption of the new tile. Warning The caption of a tile must be unique. If you try to enter a caption that already exists, you will see an error. Done. You will be redirected to \"My Tiles\" and there you will see your new tile. Tiles as a widget Because the \"Tiles app\" is a \"My apps\" member, this means that it can behave as a widget. This automatically means the following: You can show it in any form you want (i.e., to \"plug\" it as a widget panel).

Searching is initiated only if there isn't any match with the fields before them. This applies to dropdown lists as well. Results By default, DefaultSearchMembers in entities which have a code and name return the code and the name as part of the search results. Searching in dropdown lists and domain API returns only results which are based on the first field for which there are matches. Subsequent searches are not undertaken. If a search operation finds an exact match, the value is filled automatically in the corresponding field. Example Open the Invoicing module from the web client.

In short, Social ERP means a concept that helps you focusing your attention on what matters now. To you. Let's give an example with something that is certainly familiar. Facebook- one of the most popular social networks. What happens if someone mentions you in a comment to a post? And what if you \"follow\" a page or a specific post? Or if someone liked your post or comment? You will be notified. Because it concerns you. It's the same in ERP.net. We have adopted the well-known practices of social networks in your business processes. This generally means that: You can have discussions in the context of a business object or process. You can \"follow\" an object and receive notifications when something related to it happens. Mentions, e.g. automatic notification when you are involved in a discussion.

The \"following\" process means that you are \"subscribed\" to specific objects- i.e. that you want to know when something happens in their context. As a result, you will start receiving individual notifications. Another detail is that a new tile will be automatically created in the My Object follows app. It will visualize the number of new notifications concerning you, and will always stay as you are following the corresponding object. Starting an object follow can be done in two ways- manually and automatically. (Un)follow an object manually As the name suggests, this is done manually. To do this, open the object you want to follow and click on the star at the top right of the form. When it's filled up, this indicates that you're already following the object. Accordingly, to stop following it, just click it again. Auto object follow Automatic follow of an object is also possible. Such an example is when you are mentioned in a discussion of an object that you have not yet followed. The moment this happens, in addition to your new \"object follow\", you will also receive a notification, containing who exactly mentioned you. More information can be found at Chatter mentions .
