    "keywords": "Enter stops Enter stops can be used to speed up the process of creating and editing data fields. They prioritize essential steps by leaving out those the user may want to easily skip. Whether it is for fields or panels, enter stops allow for faster and more intuitive management of pages. Unlike the tab key, which always goes through each and every field and panel, the Enter key’s usage can be customized. When editing the document, if enter stops are configured and you are pressing the enter key when you are done editing a field, some fields will be skipped and the cursor will automatically move from one important field to another. Setting enter stops with data fields In Edit mode, you can choose which data fields work with enter stops by clicking the Settings icon at the top right corner of a document. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab. Take a note of the boxes under Enter Stop . During editing, fields with checkmarks are prioritized while empty ones are skipped . This setting won’t delete them from the database. Select the ones you will more likely need to fill out every time you create a sales order, and close the window. Setting enter stops with panels Further to individual fields, you can also choose which entire panels should be skipped and which ones should be prioritized. You can configure this behavior by clicking the Settings icon at the Panels section. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab again, select which panels should be considered enter stops, and close the window. The ones without the checkbox will be skipped when pressing the enter key while editing the document. Using enter stops To put the changes you’ve made into practice, simply press the Enter key while editing a document. Doing this again moves the blue highlights from one prioritized field to the next. The highlighted path follows the fields with checkmarks in a chronological order. In this case, the user starts with “Customer” and goes directly to “From Party”, skipping \"Access Key\". Enter stops can be applied not only to fields but also to icons and buttons such as Next and Create New , this way significantly speeding up the editing process compared to only click-based programs."

We'll skip the description of the trivial calendar functionality- how you can navigate between the months, how the today's date is marked, etc... We'll just show you the essentials. Activities This is the main goal of the calendar in the ERP.net Web Client. It will show in a convenient way all your activities. This way you can see them in a convenient, natural way, without the need to open navigators, apply filters, etc. Also you can create a new activity. Just click on the \"Create\" button: Fill in the required fields, save it and you're done. The new activity will appear on the day for which it's planned. View types The calendar app supports different view types. You can switch between them from the app's panel settings. When you choose the new type of view, the changes will take effect immediately. Monthly The default view type. Self-explanatory, shows the days of the selected month, alignining the raster with the days of the previous and next, graying them out. Workweek An alternative view, showing the five days of the selected work week as columns. The working time will be visualized on the vertical axis. Smart responsiveness Why smart? Because it doesn't just scale to the size of your screen, but it takes into account how you really could use it, according the size of your screen. If your screen doesn't show a large area (e.g., your mobile), then the so-called responsiveness comes. That's the monthly view on a mobile. Yes, it's not just scaled, it's a different layout to fit your needs. The activities are shown as \"dots\" and now you have agenda. Click (more specifically \"touch\") on a day and the agenda will show your activities as a list. Additionally, you may notice that the calendar's toolbar is refactored. Now you have header and footer toolbars. Mobile touch gestures support Mobile touch gestures are also supported. You can swipe left or right on your screen and as a result, you will move the calendar backward or forward. I am a widget This is not something new for a \"My app\", but rather a key functionality.

Note Panels that host My apps are called widget panels or simply widgets. So what do you think you can do with widget panels? You can visualize them anywhere . Yes, literally everywhere. In any form in ERP.net Web Client. What's more, they are smart - i.e. they take into account the context in which they are displayed and show only relevant content. See, for example, My Tiles . How much information it displays in its main screen: And see now what it visualizes if placed in Crm -> Common: Or even more specifically - Crm -> Common -> Price Lists: This is the idea - contextual information at your fingertips, easily accessible anywhere.

As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are several tiles representing the same navigator, but the number of objects they show is different. The difference is that some have applied filters. This is just the Customers navigator, but with an applied filter.

Here it is: This will open the interpolated string builder, so you can easily set up your interpolated string. Remarks Internally, the web view presents its content via an <iframe/> . This means that there're some limitations: The website (or service) you want to display in a web view must allow this. This is controlled by the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header, and if set to DENY or SAMEORIGIN , the web view won't be able to visualize it. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options The website (or service) requires authentication, managed by authentication cookies which are restricted to a first-party or same-site context. This means that the external website should explicitly set that the auth cookies will be sent in cross-site requests. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite If this is an external application, using ERP.net Identity Site for authentication, the Id site must be the same one, as for ERP.net Web Client.

Starting an object follow can be done in two ways- manually and automatically. (Un)follow an object manually As the name suggests, this is done manually. To do this, open the object you want to follow and click on the star at the top right of the form. When it's filled up, this indicates that you're already following the object. Accordingly, to stop following it, just click it again. Auto object follow Automatic follow of an object is also possible. Such an example is when you are mentioned in a discussion of an object that you have not yet followed.

    "keywords": "Picking routes Workers who physically pick items for the warehouse orders use picking routes to guide them through the process. The route is calculated using the \"Suggest warehouse locations\" function that is available in the Orders menu of WMS worker. The picking route takes into account the different parameters that are set up for the warehouse, such as: The Zones specified as picking zones through the \"Zone Type\" policy; The Locations addresses that are used to calculate the best route through the warehouse; as well as other factors, such as: the availability in the different locations – suggests the location with the smallest availability that is enough to fulfill the order; and the lot’s Expiry Date. Note The Pick task type is not yet supported by the system. Is is replaced by the Dispatch task type, which directly issues the product from the Warehousе. Currently, the function can only be used for dispatch Warehouse Orders i.e. Warehouse Orders whose lines are only with Dispatch or Comp-dispatch task type. How to use it? Open the Orders menu of WMS Worker. This takes you to a list of the orders that are available for execution for the current worker. Click on the outbound order you would like to execute. This will open a screen containing the lines of the order and their details. At the bottom of the screen, you will find a three-dot button, from which you can access the Suggest Warehouse Locations function: This will start the processing of the lines and the calculation of the function. When the processing is done, the function will load all Locations that were successfully determined in the Loc column and will automatically sort the lines ascending by the location's address. This will form the route that the worker needs to follow to sequentially collect all products from the order. The worker can start following the route by clicking the Execute button. This will display the first screen which contains the information about the suggested Location and will lead the worker to it. When the worker reaches the Location, he has to scan the Location and perform the rest of the line execution as usual. Once the execution of the first line is finished, the system will bring the worker back to the lines menu and will automatically select the next line that is available for execution and by this, will lead the worker to the next Location of the route. What if the function could not suggest a location for all lines? The order lines for which the system could not find a suitable Location to suggest will be sorted last - after all lines with successfully suggested locations. This way, when the worker finishes following the suggested route, he can still execute the remaining lines without suggestions. The system will not guide the worker to a particular location, but the Location screen during the line execution contains provides convenient panels e.g. the Availability panel, which the worker can use to find a location from where he can still pick the product."

    "keywords": "Reconcile The Reconcile menu allows you to make a comparison between the quantity of the product counted by the employees and the expected availability. This happens in real-time by Lots and Serial numbers. The location barcode must be scanned (by scanning Product, Lot, Serial, etc) or selected from the drop-down menu first: The system will give you a summary of the information it has for that product: The last column in the table shows the Expected availability compared to the one counted by the employee (Counted). When you have counted the quantity of a product, you can enter it in the Quantity field (either click on the row in the table or click Next until you are asked for the quantity): After clicking the Next button, the corresponding row in the table will be colored. If Expected and Counted are equal, the row will be colored green, but if the numbers are different, it will be colored red, indicating an error: If the Counted data needs to be deleted, this can be done by clicking on the Recycle bin icon on the right. When the counting is complete, you can see a Review of all rows in the table with their matches and differences. If there are rows in which no counted information is entered, they will be displayed with negative values of the expected quantity. This means that these products may have been available, but since they were not reported, they are recorded as missing. Review shows the results of the counting and in that sense - the Reconcile of the whole location. Total difference shows the reported differences at this Location. The button means that the counting is complete, and you are ready to save the data to the system. If all the steps are performed correctly, a message will appear confirming that the operation was successful:"
