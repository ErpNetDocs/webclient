    "summary": "How to use Advanced filter Advanced filter panel is a side panel, that serves for extraction of data in a navigator. Upon opening it, the panel displays default combinations of filter fields + comparison types (+ values) that apply to the current navigator. Following are the main elements and mode of exploitation of the Advanced filter in WEB. Three types of filters Filters are distinguished by the accompanying icon and colour: • Common (dynamic) – а filling funnel – it is recognized as such when added with the + button, through the filtering row or an URL is opened; • Pinned – a pin – always active, when you pin a common filter or when it is added through the Customize panel section; • Locked – a locker – when you lock a common or pinned filter. It is always active and accessible for edit only by admins. Colours A contour filter icon denotes lack of value. A solid colour filter icon denotes presence of value. Pinned and locked filters also change field name font colour to blue. Note \"Empty\" IS a value. Apply After you supply а value to the filter, the Apply button lights in orange colour and executes the filtering. Save layout The button activates when a significant change to filters is done. Clicking on the filter icon calls the options pin/unpin and lock/unlock to manage the type. Now you have saved the set filters in the panel. How to add a filter? There are several ways to add a filter: By clicking on the + button (add a common filter) A window \"Advanced filter\" pops-up. There you choose the field from a list, the comparison type and the value. Confirmation with the Enter key leads to the next field, until you reach the final OK button. All attributes are chooseable. Note Calculated attributes do not support filtering. Through the navigation row (add a common filter). When you insert a value in a column in the navigation row, the parameters are automatically added to the Advanced filter set. Note Filtering by the row is supported only for attributes that have the comparison type “contains”. Calculated attributes and Stored attributes are exempt. Stored attribute as a Date can be selected in the navigation row, but not filtered properly by the advanced filter. Through a URL – the filter combinations of the address are loaded in the panel. Through the Customize panel (add a pinned valueless filter) Switch on predefined combinations of filter fields + comparison types. One and the same field can be chosen several times with the supported comparison types e.g. Assigned to User is equal to, Assigned to User is one of, Assigned to User contains etc. How to edit a filter? Only modification of values is possible. A click in the filter opens the value field. You can insert values, choose from a list of values and for date fields select from a calendar. If you need to edit the filter completely, you should either delete and add it again with a different comparison typre, or add it for the second time with the desired comparison type. How to delete a filter? Use the X button next to the filter to completely delete a common filter and to clear the value of a pinned filter. Locked filters cannot be altered. Customize panel This completely new concept targets the tasks of administrators and consultants to adjust well in advance the desired filters and layout of the panel. Tab Items consists of all possible combinations of attributes (system and stored) plus supported comparison types e.g. Deal contains, Deal is one of, Currency directory is equal to, Currency directory contains… Adding one and the same filter field is possible, but with different supported comparison types. The action is inclusive (one combination does not deactivate the other). The supported comparison types are dependent on the type of field, indicated in the domain model. Advanced users switch on the filters that adds non-value pinned filters in the panel. Users then tune them with the value. Tab Reorder contains all pinned and locked filters for further rearrangement or deletion. Note The screenshots taken for this article are from v.25 of the platform."

    "summary": "Enter stops Enter stops can be used to speed up the process of creating and editing data fields. They prioritize essential steps by leaving out those the user may want to easily skip. Whether it is for fields or panels, enter stops allow for faster and more intuitive management of pages. Unlike the tab key, which always goes through each and every field and panel, the Enter key’s usage can be customized. When editing the document, if enter stops are configured and you are pressing the enter key when you are done editing a field, some fields will be skipped and the cursor will automatically move from one important field to another. Setting enter stops with data fields In Edit mode, you can choose which data fields work with enter stops by clicking the Settings icon at the top right corner of a document. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab. Take a note of the boxes under Enter Stop. During editing, fields with checkmarks are prioritized while empty ones are skipped. This setting won’t delete them from the database. Select the ones you will more likely need to fill out every time you create a sales order, and close the window. Setting enter stops with panels Further to individual fields, you can also choose which entire panels should be skipped and which ones should be prioritized. You can configure this behavior by clicking the Settings icon at the Panels section. From there, navigate to the Reorder tab again, select which panels should be considered enter stops, and close the window. The ones without the checkbox will be skipped when pressing the enter key while editing the document. Using enter stops To put the changes you’ve made into practice, simply press the Enter key while editing a document. Doing this again moves the blue highlights from one prioritized field to the next. The highlighted path follows the fields with checkmarks in a chronological order. In this case, the user starts with “Customer” and goes directly to “From Party”, skipping \"Access Key\". Enter stops can be applied not only to fields but also to icons and buttons such as Next and Create New, this way significantly speeding up the editing process compared to only click-based programs."

    "title": "How to filter by (me), (current), and (empty) | ERP.net Web Client",
    "summary": "How to filter by (me), (current), and (empty) You can use filtering expressions for applicable attributes to narrow down the scope of what is displayed in a particular navigator. They are specified in the filter row found under some columns of the respective navigator as well as in the Advanced filter panel using the contains operator. If the filtering row is not visible, you can enable it through the panel's menu or by clicking on the filter icon on the far-left of the columns. Example: Within the Orders panel of the Sales module, you input \"(me)\" in the filtering row of the Assigned To User column. This results in only documents assigned to you to be displayed in the table. Rules and syntax Filtering expressions follow a fixed syntax that can influence the outcome they produce. It's therefore crucial to write them down exactly as they are if you want to achieve the desired effect. Note You can apply more than one filtering expressions at a time. This way, your navigator could visualize items that are related to your current user and also associated with your current enterprise company and its location. (current) This expression enables you to conveniently locate documents related to your current enterprise company, its location, or a role. Example: Input \"(current)\" into the filtering row of the Enterprise Company column. Only items associated with the company you're currently logged in with, will be displayed in the table. (empty) This expression can be inserted into all fields that support the \"equals\" and \"contains\" operators. It works as a Null filter, making a navigator reveal items that do not contain data for the column in which (empty) is applied. Example: Input \"(empty)\" into the filtering row of the Enterprise Company Location column. Only items that do not have an enterprise company location will be displayed in the table. (me) This expression enables you to locate only the documents related to the user you are currently logged in as, eliminating the need to search for your own username in a field's dropdown list. It can be applied to all fields referring to the Systems.Security.Users Entity. Example: Input \"(me)\" into the filtering row of the Assigned To User column. Only items assigned to the user you're logged in as will be displayed in the table. Note When you input expressions in filtering row, popup suggestions will appear to speed up the writing process. (me) or (empty) It's possible to apply the (me) and (empty) expressions separated by an \"or\" operator in the same filtering row. As a result, the navigator will display items that meet either of these conditions. Example: Input \"(me) or (empty)\" into the filtering row of the Assigned To User column. Unassigned items as well as items assigned to the user you're logged in as will be displayed in the table. (current) or (empty) Similarly, you can apply the (current) and (empty) expressions within the same filtering row, again separated by an \"or\" operator. Example: Input \"(current) or (empty)\" into the filtering row of the Enterprise Company Location column. Items not related to an enterprise company location as well as those associated with the current one will be displayed in the table. Using tiles with filtering expressions When you apply one or more expressions to a navigator, you can create a tile for it in order to save its current filtering configuration. Note If you access a filtered navigator through a tile, data will always be adjusted to match that of the respective logged in user, their current company and location, or the role they are assigned at the moment. When a navigator filtered by (me) is accessed through a tile, for instance, it will always display records relevant to the currently logged-in user. Example: Filter a sales order navigator to display only the documents related to the current enterprise company. Then, create a tile for it, naming it “Orders for current company”. When you save your tile, you will be able to access it from within the Tiles app in the My module, or directly from the respective navigator if it's integrated as a panel.

They are specified in the filter row found under the date columns of the respective navigator as well as in the Advanced filter panel using the contains operator. If the filtering row is not visible, you can enable it through the panel's menu or by clicking on the filter icon on the far-left of the columns. Example: Within the Orders panel of the Sales module, you input \"(today)\" in the filtering row of the Document Date column. This results in only items created on the current date to be displayed in the table. Rules and syntax Period expressions follow a fixed syntax that can influence the outcome they produce. It's therefore crucial to write them down exactly as they are if you want to achieve the desired effect. Relative time expressions These expressions are word-based and surrounded by brackets. You can use them to define specific dates or broader date ranges which are always relative to the current one. Examples include \"(yesterday)\" and \"(last month)\". They always take into consideration today as a reference point. While (yesterday) will list results only from the date before today, (last month) will show results from across the entire month previous to the current one. Here's a list of relative time expressions: Expression Begin End Notes (today) 2023-11-27 2023-11-27 (yesterday) 2023-11-26 2023-11-26 (last month) 2023-10-01 2023-10-31 (current month) 2023-11-01 2023-11-30 (next month) 2023-12-01 2023-12-31 (last year) 2022-01-01 2022-12-31 (current year) 2023-01-01 2023-12-31 (next year) 2024-01-01 2024-12-31 (ytd) 2023-01-01 2023-11-27 Year-to-date (jan) 2023-01-01 2023-01-31 (jan last year) 2022-01-01 2022-01-31 Relative period expressions These expressions consist of symbols, numbers and letters and can be used in two ways: Without brackets If a period expression is used without brackets, it limits the scope of a table's records to only the ones created on specific dates relative to the current one. For example, \"-7d\" denotes the date exactly seven days before the current one, while \"+2d\" represents a date exactly two days ahead of the current one. Similarly, \"-1m\" indicates the date exactly one month before the current date, while \"+1y\" denotes the date exactly a year after the current one. To see records only for today, you can specify \"0\". Even if you add \"+\" or \"-\" before \"0\" or any letter after \"0\", the final effect will be the same. With brackets If surrounded by brackets, relative period expressions can be used to specify rounded calendar periods relative to the present moment. For example, \"(-1m)\" denotes the entire month that was before the current month, while \"(+1y)\" represents the entire year that follows the current one. To see records only for the duration of the current month, you can specify \"(0m)\". Even if you add \"+\" or \"-\" before \"0m\", the final effect will be the same. Warning \"0\" specified without brackets represents the current date regardless of whether it's used as a beginning or end. If no indicating letter is specified next to a number, the default convention is days, e.g. \"-7\" is equivalent to \"-7d\" and \"0\" represents today. When specifying a period in days, it can be written with or without brackets, e.g. \"-7\" is equivalent to \"(-7)\". Expression Begin End Notes 0m 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today +0m 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today -0m 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today -0d 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today -0y 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today 0 2024-02-27 2024-02-27 today Expressions for quarters and half years These expressions establish specific intervals within a broader timeframe. For example, \"q1\" points to the entire first quarter of the year, \"q2\" represents the second quarter, and \"h1\" denotes the first half of the year. Custom time periods You can set custom time periods to fit the results of a table into a specific timeframe. This is achieved by adding \"..\" between two period expressions or fixed dates. For instance, \"(feb)..(today)\" represents the entire time period spanning from the beginning of February up until and including the current date. Similarly, \"(yesterday)..+2d\" starts from yesterday and includes the two dates following the current date. If there is no notation before or after \"..\", it implies infinity. Thus, \"..(last month)\" would result in a navigator showing all existing records up until the final day of the last month. Note The screenshots taken for this article are from v24 of the platform."

You can enable or disable them for different creation forms and make the views of these forms distinguishable from one another. Example Different document forms will prioritise certain fields over others. When issuing a return of a product, for instance, you may want to request the original price but not the birth date of a client. Depending on its use-case, an object category can represent one or more types - Customer Type, Asset Type and Document Type. Thus, it's possible to start creating a document or an entity with an object category already selected for it. Here's a list of data types and supported object categories: Applications / Asset Мanagement: Managed Asset - Managed Asset Type Applications / Rental: Asset - Asset Type Applications / Service: Service Object - Service Object Type CRM / Common: Customer - Customer Type Finance / Assets: Asset - Asset Category General / Common: Parties - Party Type (exception, because it is an Entity Type specifier) General / Common: Document - Document Type (exception, because documents are also separated by leaf entity type) General / Products: Products - Product Type Logistics / Common: Logistic Units - Logistic Unit Type Logistics / Procurement: Supplier - Supplier Type Process You need to have at least one type of a document. For example, the Create section of the Orders panel may offer a direct sales order, a POS sales order, a standard sales order, and more. If the available options are not what you're looking for, you can manually add custom document types. This is typically done with the circular plus button found on the respective panel. Click a document type visualized on the main panel (e.g. Direct Sale Order) This will take you to the creation form of the document where an object category is already applied. Keep in mind that the field will be read-only and unable to be changed. Customize the view of the form through the Show/hide fields window. This allows you to enable or disable specific fields. Clicking outside the window once will save the view for the current document, but the settings will be reset for another document.

    "summary": "Calendar The ERP.net Web Client Calendar is a powerful time-management tool, allowing users to efficiently organize, monitor, and synchronize activities, events, and tasks. It consolidates group activities, promoting collaboration. Its features include creating events, customizing views (e.g., Workweek, Month), navigating dates, and accessing scheduled events easily. Typically, calendars are divided into distinct units of time, such as days, weeks, and months, each represented by a grid or series of pages. They often include features such as markings for holidays, special occasions, and personal reminders, enabling users to stay informed and prepared for upcoming events. Activities This is the main goal of the calendar in the ERP.net Web Client. It will show in a convenient way all your activities. This way you can see them in a convenient, natural way, without the need to open navigators, apply filters, etc. Also you can create a new activity. Just click on the \"Create\" button: Fill in the required fields, save it and you're done. The new activity will appear on the day for which it's planned. View types The calendar app supports different view types. You can switch between them from the app's panel settings. When you choose the new type of view, the changes will take effect immediately. Monthly The default view type. Self-explanatory, shows the days of the selected month, alignining the raster with the days of the previous and next, graying them out. Workweek An alternative view, showing the five days of the selected work week as columns. The working time will be visualized on the vertical axis. Smart responsiveness Why smart? Because it doesn't just scale to the size of your screen, but it takes into account how you really could use it, according the size of your screen. If your screen doesn't show a large area (e.g., your mobile), then the so-called responsiveness comes. That's the monthly view on a mobile. Yes, it's not just scaled, it's a different layout to fit your needs. The activities are shown as \"dots\" and now you have agenda. Click (more specifically \"touch\") on a day and the agenda will show your activities as a list. Additionally, you may notice that the calendar's toolbar is refactored. Now you have header and footer toolbars. Mobile touch gestures support Mobile touch gestures are also supported. You can swipe left or right on your screen and as a result, you will move the calendar backward or forward. I am a widget This is not something new for a \"My app\", but rather a key functionality. You can add a calendar wherever you want as a widget panel. My Calendar as an inline control My Calendar is also present as an inline control anywhere in ERP.net Web Client where you need to enter a date. Here's an example when creating a new activity where you need to set the document's date. In addition to date, time input is also supported. The calendar will automatically allow time input when the property you're editing requires it. As in the example from above - when specifying the date and time for a reminder in to do task. Here's what the same control looks like, but in mobile view: Of course, sometimes you only need to enter an exact time. The calendar will adapt and display only the time: Time presets The time seletion in the control is presented as a list of convenient predefined times: 10:00 / Morning 12:30 / Lunch 14:00 / Early afternoon 16:00 / Late afternoon 19:00 / Dinner If you want to set another time, you can do it manually via the input at the bottom. Customizing time presets It's also possible to completely redefine the time presets to suit your needs. This can be done via the global configuration options via the key Calendar/TimePresets. When this key has value, conforming to the format below, it overrides the default time presets. <PresetName1>=<H>:<M>;<PresetName2>=<H>:<M>;... e.g., Morning=10:00;Lunch=12:30;Afternoon=15:00;Dinner=19:00"

    "title": "Documents | ERP.net Web Client",
    "summary": "Documents My Documents is an application dedicated to organizing all documents in ERP.net which you are somehow involved with. These could be the ones you created and assigned to yourself, along with those which your colleagues created and assigned to you afterwards. Apart from offering instant access to each document, the application gives you various ways of customizing how they are displayed. You no longer need to search across different modules and dozens of system navigators in order to find the document that you need. In My Documents, they are all conveniently united in one place. Important prerequisites Upon creation, all ERP.net documents have an Assigned To User field that determines the person whose personalized environment they appear in. By default, new documents are automatically assigned to the person creating them (e.g. you). You also have the option to assign them to someone else. Note Currently, you always provide the login of the user (as defined in Setup -> Security -> Users), and not their actual name. If the Assigned To User field is not visible, you need to reveal it manually by customizing the document creation panel. This will enable you to change the person the document is assigned to. Once a user is specified and the document is saved, it will appear in the user's respective My Documents environment. Features You can take advantage of various buttons, fields, customization features, and menus to better navigate and organize your documents. Documents table At the very center of My Documents is a table presenting all the documents which are somehow related to your account. You can not only preview, but also interact with this table, starting from simple operations, such as filtering, sorting, and accessing your documents. The app also empowers users to go to more advanced options like grouping documents by column headers and displaying summarized data about the documents. Search The search bar above the table is intended to help you find a specific document. Simply provide a detail related to it, like its number, date, or the type of document you are looking for - a meeting, appointment, offer, sales order, etc. The search will return a list of all the documents that contain the detail you searched for. Actions menu You can click the vertical three-dot button to expand a menu containing a list of actions. It allows you to perform a wide variety of operations, such as reloading your records, exporting the table with its data, and even grouping your documents by one or more parameters. Show grouping panel You can use the Show grouping panel feature to arrange your documents in groups based on a certain parameter, visualized by its respective column header. For instance, you may want to separate the full list of your existing documents into several groups. These groups could organize documents by their type, state, the month they were created on, and so on. To begin, click on the Show grouping panel, then drag and drop a column header right into the field (space) that appears above the table. Once you do that, the documents will be arranged in groups based on that column (e.g. Document Type). Documents having the same value determined by a column header will appear under it. You can also group your documents in a multi-level, hierarchical order by providing multiple column headers. In that case, the documents will be further categorized in groups based on the column that was placed first, followed by the rest of the grouped columns in a consecutive order. By adding more groups, you configure the table to visualize the documents in a more structured and navigation-friendly way. For example, let's say you add a Document Type column header first, then a Document Date column header second: Two levels of groups will show up. The first-level groups will indicate what type of documents each of them contains - for example, activities, offers, sales orders, etc. The second-level groups will further narrow the range of documents down to the date they were issued on - for example, only the offers issued for a specific year, month, or date. Tip You can gain insights into your data from different points of view by changing the column headers that you group or simply by switching their order. Summary You can gather useful statistical information about each column and use it for operational and analytical purposes by taking advantage of My Documents' Summary feature. Summary allows you to gain an overview of your documents by enabling you to automatically perform arithmetic and logical operations to the list of documents assigned to you. Using Summary, you can find out the number of documents (in a group or in total) containing a specific value in them or the number of documents containing entirely unique values. Simply right-click on a column header and select Summary from the menu. This will open a list of available functions. Count - It calculates the number of documents where a specific value in a field is present. Distinct - It counts all the unique instances of all values within a field in the current navigator form. For fields with a number data type, you can see other details such as Max or Min values. Note The Distinct option sums up the number of values that are present in your documents, taking into account only the first repetition for repetitive values. To illustrate how these options work, imagine the following situation. You want to find out the total number of documents you have in different states. You want to consider how many states you have documents in. Let's say you have three documents in New, one in Firm Planned, and two in Released state. If you use Count on the State column header, the option will display the result of 6. This is the total number of instances where the state value is present in your documents. Using Distinct, however, will total at the number 3, as these are all the distinct states you have documents in. The rest of the values for state are just repetitions of some value that is already present. Panel customization Like most My apps, the Documents application can be freely customized to your preferences. Simply click the Customize panel option from the three-dot actions menu found at the top-right corner of the table. This will open a window with two tabs: Items You can hide or reveal columns in the documents table from the System section of this tab. Toggle the slider button next to the desired column to trigger the respective action. Reorder You can change the order of the table column headers to better fit your preferences. Drag them up and down until they form the desired sequence. Note You can also reorder your columns by dragging and dropping them horizontally across the table itself. Menu There's an additional Menu button in the ribbon above the table that allows you to interact with the entire My Documents application. You can take advantage of more global features, such as opening a document's Details, viewing more Detail panels, adding widgets, creating different tiles, and showing them multiple times. Side panel The panel available in the Side panel section can provide invaluable information for your documents, as well as allow you to apply additional filters to the table. For instance, you can display the Details panel, allowing you to view in-depth information about each of your documents. This enables you to preview the document's data in a fast and easy way, without even having to open the document's form. In addition, you can select some of the Detail panels - these panels carry data related to the primary document you are reviewing. Tip The Details panel and each Detail panel (related to the document currently at view) will visualize data for the respective document as soon as you select its row. You can rapidly preview such data for a number of documents - simply switch between the rows of the primary table when ready. Document flow Oftentimes, a document is issued as part of a sequence of documents, called a document chain. Having the Document flow panel at your disposal gives you an easy way to traverse the whole document chain and quickly access all documents related to the current one. If a document is released as part of other documents, the entire chain will show up here. Tiles You can save a specific configuration of the My documents page and create a tile for it. In case you have set a combination of filters, the tile will store them as well. Whenever you visit your personalized Tiles environment, the respective Documents tile will be available to access directly from there. Customize form Last but not least, you can customize the look and feel of your Documents application. Simply select Customize form from the Menu button's dropdown. A window with two tabs will open: Items Here, you can hide or reveal certain panels, widgets, and items from the main page. Toggle their sliders off or on, respectively, to achieve the desired action. It is here that you can also include additional widget panels dedicated to your favorite documents, document-related tiles, and different web views. You can include up to five tile panels in your Documents application. This allows you to have readily available configurations which can alter the appearance of the page when clicked, based on the filters and grouping configurations applied. Reorder You can change the order of the items on the page by dragging them up and down until they form the desired layout. Use the Position option to determine how each of the item panels you want to visualize. You can select between a Fill, Left, or Right position to neatly order your panels and make the best use of your screen space."

General responsibilities Every social group in ERP.net comes with three predefined roles for user assignment, each having fixed permission levels that cannot be customized. If users with limited access need to get a broader range of capabilities, they must be promoted to a role offering extra features. Similarly, in case a member needs to get demoted, they can be assigned a role that prevents them from performing a certain set of actions.

    "summary": "Overview \"My Tiles\" is a specialized app that allows you to see the number of objects for entities of interest to you. E.g., all your customers or all new customers for this year. All products or all products in a specific group, etc... A sample view of the tiles app. Tile Each tile is a simple piece of data. It shows just two things- a caption and a number. The title is user-defined, and the number represents the objects count. Internally, each tile represents an entity (i.e. a repository) and the number it shows is the number of objects in it. As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are several tiles representing the same navigator, but the number of objects they show is different. The difference is that some have applied filters. This is just the Customers navigator, but with an applied filter. FromDate >= \"2019-01-01\" and FromDate <= \"2020-01-01\" Additionally, each tile is a link to its navigator with an applied filter (if any). This means that you just need to click it and its corresponding filtered navigator will open. Creating a tile You can follow the steps below to create a tile: Open a navigator of your choice. If you want some filtering, just apply it. Then open the form's main menu and select \"Create a new tile\". A dialog will open where you can enter the caption of the new tile. Warning The caption of a tile must be unique. If you try to enter a caption that already exists, you will see an error. Done. You will be redirected to \"My Tiles\" and there you will see your new tile. Tiles as a widget Because the \"Tiles app\" is a \"My apps\" member, this means that it can behave as a widget. This automatically means the following: You can show it in any form you want (i.e., to \"plug\" it as a widget panel). Will show only the tiles that are part of the host context (e.g., you don't need \"Customer\" related tiles in \"Production\")."

    "summary": "Overview The web view is a special type of panel allowing you to show an external website or a service. Inside the ERP.net Web Client, as a part of its layout. The web view panel can be plugged as a separate panel in any page, part of the ERP.net Web Client. Here's an example of how it looks in the customers navigator, Another one - this time in a sales order. Set up a web view It's easy. Navigate to the place where you want to show a web view. For this example we'll use the customers navigator. Open the form's settings via its context menu and select the \"Show/hide panels\" option. Now expand the \"Widget Panels\" section and you'll see 3 web view panels. Note You can show up to 3 web view panels in each form. For now, just toggle the visibility switch of the first one. Your new web view panel will be added at the end of the page. Initially, the web view is not set and will look like this: It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Just open the context menu and activate the \"Edit mode\": Now the web view panel will be in edit mode. This means that you can set its URL address. Type the external URL in the corresponding input and hit \"Save\". Additionally, you can specify the vertical size of the panel. All sizes are relative to the viewport- the visible area of the web page. Small = 30% of the page height Regular = 50% Large = 60% Full = 100% - i.e. the whole page. Done. Your web view is set. String interpolation Above, it was explained how you can specify the URL for the web view. But there's one detail- this isn't just an URL, it's an interpolated string. If you paid attention earlier when we were setting up the URL for the web view, there was a button in the corresponding input. Here it is: This will open the interpolated string builder, so you can easily set up your interpolated string. Remarks Internally, the web view presents its content via an <iframe/>. This means that there're some limitations: The website (or service) you want to display in a web view must allow this. This is controlled by the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header, and if set to DENY or SAMEORIGIN, the web view won't be able to visualize it. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options The website (or service) requires authentication, managed by authentication cookies which are restricted to a first-party or same-site context. This means that the external website should explicitly set that the auth cookies will be sent in cross-site requests. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite If this is an external application, using ERP.net Identity Site for authentication, the Id site must be the same one, as for ERP.net Web Client. The reason is simple. Actually, this is the same as the previous limitation. ERP.net Identity Site's cookies are restricted to the same-site context."

    "title": "Navigator features | ERP.net Web Client",
    "summary": "Navigator features There are several features and behaviors that are common for all ERP.net Web Client navigators. Default sorting If you haven't customized the view of a document navigator in any way, or if you have reset your current view's settings to default, they will be sorted by Document Date in a descending order. This is done for convenience, as it allows you to see the documents which were most recently created first. Accessing records In most navigators, you can access a document or a record through the value of its first column, regardless of which column that is. Values displayed in the rows of that column are accessible through hyperlinks leading exactly to the document they represent. Note Certain navigators don't support opening links and therefore don't have this feature enabled. You can alternatively access the document form of a record: By clicking on it, then expanding its Details panel and finally clicking on the Open button By clicking on its icon positioned in the System column at the far-left. Note The System column always contains a quick-access button for the respective record and its position cannot be modified Navigator menu Each navigator features its own dedicated Menu through which you can perform the following: Determine the security type of each navigator record by configuring access permissions Build and apply advanced filters Use ERP.net's dedicated AI Asssistant (upcoming) Take advantage of side panels that reveal additional data and attachments for each selected document Use functional panels to speed up the process of filling out a document View Hierarchy references and apply filters based on them Expand detail panels to see information relevant for each selected record of the navigator (e.g. its Document Lines) Create tiles to save and later easily access a specific navigator view Customize the navigator form by enabling, disabling, reordering and renaming its panels and widgets. Hierarchy The Hierarchy feature works with navigators having one or more references to hierarchical nomenclatures. When there are multiple references, it reveals side panels representing all available hierarchies together with their comprising elements. Each hierarchy uses a tree-like structure to organize its elements, starting with the hierarchy itself and going further into its elements. For instance, clicking on the Adjusted Document hierarchy in Invoices will expand a side panel displaying all adjusted documents. You can click any element of a hierarchy to apply an instant filter on the contents of the respective navigator. In the case of Adjusted Document, clicking on an element of that hierarchy will filter the Invoices page to show only invoices for which this particular adjusted document has been created. Note Only one filter can be applied through Hierarchy at a time. Certain hierarchies like Product Group have their elements organized into sub-elements. In that case, you can filter the respective navigator both by the more global element and by its more specific sub-elements. If there is only one reference to a hierarchical nomenclature in a navigator, the Hierachy button will be replaced by it. Note The screenshots taken for Hierarchy are from v25 of the Web Client. Panel menu Panels and widgets enabled in a navigator have a separate Menu button accessible at their top-right corners. It features the ability to: Maximize the panel to take up the entire screen Reload the panel to reflect the most up-to-date information Quickly create a new record of one or more respective types Search the contents of the respective panel Take advantage of handy advanced features like the Grouping panel and Filter row Select multiple records from the panel Create a .xlsx file containing all records of the panel Limit the row counts of the panel to a specific number Customize the panel by enabling, disabling, reordering and renaming its columns. Multi select Whenever you select multiple records using the Multi select feature, a new Selected count button will appear on the navigator's ribbon. It allows you to export the selected records as .xlsx files Group by column headers With the help of the Show grouping panel, you can also group a navigator's records based on one or more column headers. Such groups can be used to organize records by type, state, the month they were created on, etc. Row context menu If you right-click on a particular row, you will expand a dropdown menu with one or more of the following options: Open the row's associated record Apply an advanced filter affecting the entire panel, using this particular row as source (e.g. documment currency) Access the form definition of the row (only for fields that can be defined). Column context menu If you right-click on a particular column, you will expand a dropdown menu with the following options: Sort the column's contents by ascending or descending order Clear the sorting, restoring the column view to default Group the records of the column by specific criteria based on the type of the column (word-based, time-based, etc.) Summarize columns using functions like Summary and Distinct Restore the column's default width Hide the column from view (can be re-enabled through the Panel customization Menu) Grouping Depending on the type of a column (e.g. Date, Number, Document Type), you can perform more specific grouping operations. This is achieved through character counts (for text-based columns) or time periods (for time-based columns). Example: We can group records by the business week indicated in their Document Date column. As a result, the entire panel will be divided into \"BW\" groups that include records created in the respective business week. Attempting to group records by Document No will offer different grouping options. Tip If you right-click on a column header with an grouping filter applied, you can expand or collapse all groups at once. Sorting summarized groups If a Summary function is applied on a column, you can use it to sort existing groups. Groups can be sorted based on their own column or by columns which have summary functions applied. Note The screenshots for this article are from v24 and v26 of the Web Client."

In short, Social ERP means a concept that helps you focusing your attention on what matters now. To you. Let's give an example with something that is certainly familiar. Facebook- one of the most popular social networks. What happens if someone mentions you in a comment to a post? And what if you \"follow\" a page or a specific post? Or if someone liked your post or comment? You will be notified. Because it concerns you. It's the same in ERP.net. We have adopted the well-known practices of social networks in your business processes. This generally means that: You can have discussions in the context of a business object or process. You can \"follow\" an object and receive notifications when something related to it happens. Mentions, e.g. automatic notification when you are involved in a discussion. Some of the key aspects in the Social ERP are the Chatter and the process of object following (i.e., Social follows). You can read more in the additional sections to this page."

    "summary": "Overview Social follows is a key aspect in Social ERP. The act of 'following' an object is akin to subscribing to updates for that specific item. In essence, it signifies that you want to know when something happens within its context, making it one of your 'favorite' objects. As a result of following, you'll receive individual notifications related to this object. Furthermore, this action automatically triggers the creation of a new tile within the My Favorites app. This tile visually displays the count of new notifications relevant to the object you're following. Importantly, the tile remains present as long as you continue following the corresponding object. Adding an object to your favorites (i.e., following it) can happen in two ways: either by doing it manually or having it done automatically. (Un)follow an object manually Just as the name implies, this process is manual. To achieve it, open the object you wish to follow and click on the star icon located at the upper right corner of the form. When the star icon is filled, it means the object is already in your favorites. To unfollow it, simply click the star icon again. Auto object follow Automatically following an object is also an option. For instance, if you're mentioned in a discussion about an object you haven't followed yet, it will be automatically added to your favorites. When this occurs, along with the new 'object follow,' you'll receive a notification specifying who mentioned you. You can find further details in the Chatter mentions.
