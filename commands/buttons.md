# Buttons
Buttons are available everywhere in the platform - on the top ribbon, inside a panel, in the navigation panel...They are accompanied with a text (can be hidden) and a hint to indicate what would happen when pressed.
In our platform we chose icons and toggle switches to serve as buttons. In this section we will explain the most common buttons you see on the top ribbon of a record or navigator.
