# Command Tools in @@webclient 

These consist of Command buttons and Context menus. This section will explain each command button and context menu features in details — its purpose, behavior, and expected results when clicked. 
## Command buttons

An essential part of the ERP.net Web Client interface. They perform actions ranging from saving and closing entries to initiating processes, navigating between views, and interacting with documents and data. These buttons are typically displayed at the top of panels and forms, or in the context menus, providing direct access to frequently used commands and functionalities.

Each command button consists of a text and a symbol that visually reinforces its purpose, helping users understand its function at a glance. Symbols (icons) are so carefully selected, so that the button actually becomes a sign and even the text can be omitted (not shown) because thus it intuitively represent the action performed.

All command buttons also include helpful tooltips that appear when hovered over, providing users with clear hints about the button’s function before clicking.

While some command buttons are standardized across the system (e.g., Save, Close, Delete, Print), and others are contextual and appear depending on the type of record or process being handled.

## Context menus

They vary largely depending on the element, the feature, the field they serve. These menus contain specific operations that are executable for the panel, the form, the field, the feature currently being used. They serve the buttons too - e.g. button RUN contains a context menu of various functions.

The menus are indicated either with a three dots icon, or a down-arrow, from the button itsel, or can be revealed with a right-click on the element (e.g. field, comment).
