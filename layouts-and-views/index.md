# Layouts and Views in @@webclient

The @@webclient is designed around flexible layouts and views that help users work efficiently with data, regardless of role or device.

## Layouts

A **layout** defines how the interface elements are arranged within a view. It refers to the arrangement and organization of the positioning of fields, panels, tabs, and related data sections, gateways to modules and applications too. Filters in Advanced filter panel also affect the layout.

### 1. Key characteristics of layouts:

- Responsive design – automatically adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Logical grouping – related fields are organized into sections and tabs
- Consistency – similar documents follow similar layouts, reducing learning time

Layouts are optimized to minimize scrolling, highlight important fields, improve data entry speed and accuracy

### 2. Layout Behavior and Flexibility

- Responsive Layouts: The web client adjusts layouts to screen size (desktop vs. tablet), but specific responsive behavior is not deeply detailed in documentation.
- Panel-based design: All layouts are panel-driven, and user roles can control what appears where.
