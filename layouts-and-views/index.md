# Layouts and Views in @@webclient

The @@webclient is designed around flexible layouts and views that help users work efficiently with data, regardless of role or device.

## Layouts

A **layout** defines how the interface elements are arranged within a view. It refers to the arrangement and organization of the positioning of fields, panels, tabs, and related data sections, gateways to modules and applications too. Filters in Advanced filter panel also affect the layout.

## 1. Key characteristics of layouts:

- Responsive design – automatically adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Logical grouping – related fields are organized into sections and tabs
- Consistency – similar documents follow similar layouts, reducing learning time

Layouts are optimized to minimize scrolling, highlight important fields, improve data entry speed and accuracy

### 2. Personalization and Usability

The Web Client allows a high degree of personalization:

- Users can adjust column visibility and order in list views
- Filters and preferences can be saved per user
- Frequently used views can be accessed quickly

This ensures a clean, task-focused interface that improves productivity and reduces cognitive load.

### 3. Layout Behavior and Flexibility

- Responsive Layouts: The web client adjusts layouts to screen size (desktop vs. tablet), but specific responsive behavior is not deeply detailed in documentation.
- Panel-based design: All layouts are panel-driven, and user roles can control what appears where.


Understanding how these concepts work will allow you to personalize the interface and navigate information faster.
