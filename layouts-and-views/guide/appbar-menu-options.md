1. Pin AppBar - when On, this pins the app-bar on screen, so it is always available. When Off - the app-bar is hidden, and reveals larger operation screen. In this case the app-bar is accesible from the Start button at the topmost left corner.

2. Pin navigation - when On, this pin the navigation panel on screen, so it is always available. When Off, the panel opens after the user clicks on an item on the app-bar.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App-bar should be pinned in order to pin the navigation too.


3. Show navigation on hover - when On, the navigation panel opens when you hover over an item in the app-bar. This is useful, if you do not want to have the navigation panel always on screen.
