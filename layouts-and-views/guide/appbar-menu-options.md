# App-bar menu options

The App-bar menu lets users control the visibility and behavior of key interface elements—such as navigation, breadcrumbs, button titles, and Advanced mode—so the Web Client adapts to their preferred way of working. These settings are stored per user, and each option can be switched **On or Off**.

Explanation of the menu options

**1. Pin AppBar**
- When On, the App-bar is pinned to the screen and always visible.
- When Off, the App-bar is hidden to provide a larger working area and can be accessed from the Start button in the top-left corner.

**2. Pin navigation**
- When On, the navigation panel is pinned to the screen and always visible.
- When Off, the navigation panel opens only after the user clicks an item in the App-bar.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App-bar should be pinned in order to pin the navigation too.

**3. Show navigation on hover**
- When On, the navigation panel opens when you hover over an App-bar item.
- This is useful if you want quick access to navigation without keeping the panel permanently visible.

**4. Icon buttons text**
- When On, text labels are shown for buttons and modules.
- When Off, only icons are displayed, reducing text density and visual noise while keeping actions easily recognizable.
