# App-bar menu options

The App-bar menu lets users control the visibility and behavior of key interface elements—such as navigation, breadcrumbs, button titles, and Advanced mode—so the Web Client adapts to their preferred way of working. The settings are remember per user. The options are switched On or Off.
