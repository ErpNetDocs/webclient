# How to customize form in @@webclient

A Form is the topmost core UI component in the Web Client. It represents a single page and displays data through a structured, user-friendly interface composed of multiple panels. A form can function as the home page of a module, where different sections are shown, or as a single-record form, which presents all main, related, and detailed data for one record.

Form customization defines which panels are included in the form and how they are arranged. Through form customization, you can choose which main panels, widgets, related data panels, and detail panels are shown, as well as display the Main panel multiple times when needed.
