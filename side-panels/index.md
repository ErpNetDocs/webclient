# Side panels in @@webclient

Side panels are contextual UI components in the @@webclient that provide access to additional, supporting functionality related to the data currently shown in the central panel. They are designed to extend the main workspace without interrupting the primary flow or navigation.

Side panels always relate to a specific data context—for example, a single record or a document—and expose actions, information, or tools that help users inspect, manage, or collaborate around that data in greater depth.

They are displayed on the right-hand side of the screen, next to the central panel, and are accessed from the main three-dot menu. The set of available side panels depends on the type of data being viewed. Some panels are common across most data entities, while others appear only for specific entity types, such as documents.

Several major types of side panels exist in the Web Client. These are outlined briefly in the following sections.
