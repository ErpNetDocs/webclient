# Inventory Control

Inventory Control is a mobile warehouse management application designed to speed up and simplify basic operations with warehouse orders. It's perfectly suitable for shops and smaller stores.

It follows a similar logic to the **BarCodeCommand** pannel from within the **Desktop Client**, and allows workers to complete their tasks quickly, without going through the more complex procedures of the **[WMS module](../wms-worker/index.md)**. 

You can **receive**, **issue**, **reconcile**, **transfer** and **scrap** orders in just a few steps, thereby generating receipt stores, issue store orders and reconciliation documents in no time. Unlike with the WMS module, these actions are **not** synchronized in real-time with the ERP.net system.

### Prerequisites

Before you start using Inventory Control, you'll be prompted to select the **store** for which you want to perform different operations.

That store will be saved for follow-up operations but can easily be switched to a different one with the help of the **Change** button.
