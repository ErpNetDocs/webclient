# Introduction

Inventory Control is a warehouse management application designed to speed up and simplify basic operations with warehouse orders. 

It follows a similar logic to the **BarCodeCommand** pannel from within the **Desktop Client**, and allows workers to complete their tasks quickly, without going through the more complex procedures of the WMS module. 

You can **receive**, **issue**, **reconcile**, **transfer** and **scrap** orders in just a few steps. 

These actions are **not** synchronized in real-time with the ERP.net system.
