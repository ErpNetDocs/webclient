# Reconcile

This module allows you to **update** your warehouse or shop's current available quantities and **generate** reconciliation documents.

By occasionally counting everything, it may turn out that some products have fewer or higher quantities, or are no longer present.

The reverse could also be true: new products may be identified but not entered into the system.

**Inventory Control** allows you to reflect any of those changes within its **Reconcile** section.
