# Introduction to @@webclient

The @@Web Client is the web-based user interface of the ERP.net business-management platform. It is one of the primary ways to access and interact with all the modules inside the ERP.net system—such as CRM, financials, inventory, production, and more.

## Key features include

- **Complete access from a browser** (no heavy thick-client required), so users can log in from various devices.
- **Personalised dashboards and “My Apps” widgets**, so each user sees what matters most for their role.
- **Social-ERP style features**: following objects, discussions, mentions, notifications—bringing business processes closer to modern collaboration.
- **Flexible UI panels, web views** (embedding external sites or services within the client), and layout customisation by role.
- **Full support for data entry, editing, settings, and administration** of the ERP platform — not just “view only”.
