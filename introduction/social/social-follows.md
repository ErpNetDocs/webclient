# Overview

Social follows is a key aspect in the Social ERP. 

The "following" process means that you are "subscribed" to specific objects- i.e. that you want to know when something happens in their context. As a result, you will start receiving individual notifications. Another detail is that a new tile will be automatically created in the [My Object follows](../my-apps/object-follows/index.md) app. It will visualize the number of new notifications concerning you, and will always stay as you are following the corresponding object. 

Starting an object follow can be done in two ways- manually and automatically.

## (Un)follow an object manually

As the name suggests, this is done manually. To do this, open the object you want to follow and click on the star at the top right of the form.

When it's filled up, this indicates that you're already following the object. Accordingly, to stop following it, just click it again.

## Auto object follow

Automatic follow of an object is also possible. Such an example is when you are mentioned in a discussion of an object that you have not yet followed. The moment this happens, in addition to your new "object follow", you will also receive a notification, containing who exactly mentioned you. More information can be found at [Chatter mentions](./chatter/index.md#user-mention).
