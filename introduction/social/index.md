# Overview

At a time when social networks are a key factor in communication between us, we decided to adopt such a concept and integrate it into @@erpnet.

In short, Social ERP means a concept that helps you focusing your attention on what matters now. To you.

Let's give an example with something that is certainly familiar. Facebook- one of the most popular social networks. What happens if someone mentions you in a comment to a post? And what if you "follow" a page or a specific post? Or if someone liked your post or comment?

You will be notified. Because it concerns you.

It's the same in @@erpnet. We have adopted the well-known practices of social networks in your business processes. This generally means that:
- You can have discussions in the context of a business object or process.
- You can "follow" an object and receive notifications when something related to it happens.
- Mentions, e.g. automatic notification when you are involved in a discussion.

Some of the key aspects in the Social ERP are the [Chatter](./chatter/index.md) and the process of object following (i.e., [Social follows](social-follows.md)). You can read more in the additional sections to this page.
