# Activity participants

The My Calendar application can display not only your own activities, but also the ones you’re participating in. 
This further increases calendars’ ability to gather everything group-related in one place.
 
By default, every time an owner creates an activity, whether that’s a task, meeting or an appointment, related users have that activity automatically added to their own calendars. This is now applicable to entities registered as participants as well. 
 
Keep in mind!
If you’re both an owner and a participant of the same activity, you won’t have a duplicate of it in your calendar. The same is true for participants accidentally added twice in the activity. 
However, any two users you’ve defined as well as any participants you’ve manually linked to your activity will now get an easily accessible copy of it in their own personal calendars.
For more information on how to add users to an activity and how they can access it through the My Calendar application, please refer to the technical guide.
 
With activity participation tracking built within your calendar, you get even more insights and comfort knowing what’s next on your schedule!

 // Коментар за мен: Изрично да опиша в документацията, че за да влязат в личния календар, трябва да са дефинирани като Участници.
