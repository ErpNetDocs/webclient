# Activity participants

Your calendar is capable of displaying both the activities that you **own** and the ones you **participate** in.

This allows for better task management and increases the level of interaction you can achieve on the **My Calendar** application.

### How it works

A person of type "Owner" is capable of defining up to **two** entities of type "User". 

By default, whenever owners create a new activity, their related entities have it automatically added in their personal calendars.

The same logic can be applied to an activity's **participants**.

## Process

Any user can view and access a task, meeting, or other forms of activities they're scheduled to take part in.

The only requirement is that they must be defined as **participants** on the platform.

Keep in mind!
If you’re both an owner and a participant of the same activity, you won’t have a duplicate of it in your calendar. The same is true for participants accidentally added twice in the activity. 
However, any two users you’ve defined as well as any participants you’ve manually linked to your activity will now get an easily accessible copy of it in their own personal calendars.
For more information on how to add users to an activity and how they can access it through the My Calendar application, please refer to the technical guide.
 
With activity participation tracking built within your calendar, you get even more insights and comfort knowing what’s next on your schedule!

 // Коментар за мен: Изрично да опиша в документацията, че за да влязат в личния календар, трябва да са дефинирани като Участници.
