# How to define user roles

You can assign roles to security users and link them to specific **enterprise companies** and **company locations**. 

This option grants different permissions and responsibilities based on an employee’s workplace and department. However, the roles you’re allowed to define will **vary**. When companies are matched with locations, you can choose only the most suitable entries per combination. 

By default, users without predefined enterprise company and company location have role access to **all** of them.

## Prerequisites 

Make sure the **Roles panel** is part of the user’s standard settings definition. 
 
Open the list of default panel and toggle the **Roles** slider.
