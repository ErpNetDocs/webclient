# How to use the Product supply panel 

For **purchase order**, **transfer order**, and **work order** documents, there's a functional panel called **Product Supply**. 

It displays a list of products available for delivery at a specific store within the selected enterprise company. 

It filters products based on their procurement method, e.g. **PurchaseOrder.Supplier**, **TransferOrder.FromStore**, or **WorkOrder.DefaultStore**.
