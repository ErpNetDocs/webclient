## Panel features

The **Available products** panel includes a **search bar** and an option to **filter** products by groups.

Product quantities will be loaded only after a **store** is selected. Otherwise, the panel will be empty.

You can enter **quantities** manually, adjust them with **“+”** and **“-”** buttons, as well as determine their **measurement units**.

Newly added product quantities are interpreted as new rows in the **Lines** panel of the respective document.
