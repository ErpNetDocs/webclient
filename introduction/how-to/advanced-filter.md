# How to use Advanced Filter 

**Advanced Filter** panel is a side panel, that serves for extraction of data in a navigator.
Upon opening it, the panel displays default combinations of filter fields + comparison types (+ values) that apply to the current navigator.
Following are the main elements and mode of exploitation of the Advanced filter in WEB.

## There are three types of filters:
Filters are distinguished by the accompanying icon and colour:

•	Common (dynamic) – а filling funnel – it is recognized as such when added with the **+** button, through the filtering row or an URL is opened;
•	Pinned – a pin – always active, when you pin a common filter or when it is added through the Customize panel section;
•	Locked – a locker – when you lock a common or pinned filter. It is always active and accessible only by admins.

Clicking on the filter icon calls the options pin/unpin and lock/unlock to manage the type.

## Colours

A contour filter icon denotes lack of value. A solid colour filter icon denotes presence of value.
Pinned and locked filters also change field font colour to blue.

Note: <Empty> IS a value.

Save layout
The button activates when a significant change to filters is done e.g. pin/unpin, lock/unlock. This saves the set  filters and their types in the panel.

How to add a filter?
There are several ways to add a filter:
1.	By clicking on the + button ( adds a common filter)

        A window Advanced Filter pops-up, where you choose the field from a list, the    comparison type and the value. Confirmation with the Enter key is possible, until you reach the final OK button. All attributes are chooseable.
Note: Calculated attributes do not support filtering

2.	Through the navigation row – (adds a common filter) insert value in a column in the navigation row, the parameters are automatically added in the Advanced Filter panel. 
Filtering by the row is supported only for the comparison type “contains”

3.	Through a URL – the filter combinations of the address are loaded in the panel
4.	Through the Customize panel  - (adds a pinned valueless filter)  - switch on predefined combinations of filter fields+comparison types e.g. Assigned to User is equal to , Assigned to User is one of, Assigned to User contains etc. 


How to edit a filter?
Only modification of values is possible. A click in the filter opens the value field to alter or add value. It might be a list of values and for date fields this is a calendar.

How to delete a filter?
Use the X button next to the filter to completely delete a common filter and to clear the value of a pinned filter.
Locked filters cannot be altered.

This completely new concept targets the tasks of administrators and consultants to adjust well in advance the desired filters and layout of the panel.
