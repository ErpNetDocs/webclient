# How to use the Access Permission field

There's a way to individually control each document attachmentâ€™s accessibility by setting one of three access permission rules. 

This way, you can limit an attachment's visiblity to just the person who uploaded it, all internal users belonging to the same enterprise company, or both internal and external (e.g. Client Center) users.

To achieve precise accessibility control, you need to modify the **Access Permission** field found in the **Files** panel available for each document.

### Step-by-step process

From the **Files** panel of a document, click on the three-dot button and select the **Detail** option.

This allows you to expand settings for each uploaded attachment.

Within the detail settings, locate the **Access Permission** field and expand its dropdown menu.

This will reveal a list of options:

* **Creators only** - the file will remain visible exclusively to the person who attached it
* **Internal users** - the file will be visible to the creator and all internal users belonging to the same enterprise company
* **Internal users + external users** - the file will be visible to the creator, internal users, and external users.

Once you modify the **Access Permission** field, your changes will take effect instantly.
