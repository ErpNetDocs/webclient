# A Step-by-Step walkthrough for adding multiple instances of a panel type in ERP

Customizing the UI for a form enables you to personalize it by displaying certain panels
multiple times. Each added panel in the form is assigned a unique name, which can be modified
as necessary. A panel cannot be displayed more than five times within a single form.

## Example

Head to the **Contacts** section and within the **Activities** creation area, access the **Meeting** option.

If necessary, you can rename each item on the form. To do so, navigate to the **Reorder** tab, displaying all items currently added to the form. Click on the **Rename** icon for the specific item you wish to rename.
