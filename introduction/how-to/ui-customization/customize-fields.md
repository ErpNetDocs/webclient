# How to customize fields

When customizing panels, you can rearrange their column fields and also assign new names to them.

Use this feature to better adapt each panel to your specific needs.

### Rearrange

### Translate a column

You can also add a **translation** in a language of your choice with the **Translate** button.

When the language of the platform is changed, it will reflect this translation automatically.
