# How to create new stored or calculated attributes

While customizing a form, you have the option to introduce either a new stored attribute or a new calculated attribute. 

The addition of these fields will be automatically reflected in the form you are customizing. 

## Example 

Within an invoice order, click the **button** at the top-right corner and select **Customize panel**.
