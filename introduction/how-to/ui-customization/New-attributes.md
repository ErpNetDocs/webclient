# A Step-by-Step walkthrough for creating new stored or calculated attribute in ERP

While customizing a form, you have the option to introduce either a new stored attribute 
or a new calculated attribute. The inclusion of these fields will be automatically reflected in the form you are currently customizing. 

## Example 

Head to the **Invoicing** page within the **CRM** menu and access the **Invoice Orders** panel.
