# How to add multiple instances of a panel type

While customizing a form, you can add certain panels in it **multiple** times. 

Each added panel is assigned a unique name, which can be modified when necessary. 

One and the same panel **cannot** be displayed more than **five** times within a single form.

### Add panels

You can customize a form by clicking on the **Menu** button and choosing **Customize form**.
