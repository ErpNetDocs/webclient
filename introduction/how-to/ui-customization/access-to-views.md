# Access to Views customization

In order to be able to organize the vision and usability of the platform a User needs to have permissions. It is advised that only Admins bear such responsibility. 
Common users do not normally have rights to personalize their working environment and in general get accustomed to the settings. 
Here is a short explanation on access to WEB customization of Menu, Views, Panels and Forms depending on the User status.

* If the User IS Global Layout Manager - full access span 1-8 
* If the User IS NOT Global Layout Manager, and role Is Layout Admin = False - Zero access
* If the User IS NOT Global Layout Manager, and role Is Layout Admin = True – access span 1-6
