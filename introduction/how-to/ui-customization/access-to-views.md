# Access to views customization

In order to be able to organize the vision and usability of the platform a User needs to have permissions. It is advised that only Admins bear such responsibility. 
Common users do not normally have rights to personalize their working environment and in general should get accustomed to the settings.
<br><br>
First and foremost, system rights about layout for system groups are administered in Setup->Security->System Security Permissions section, Layout->GLobal Layout Manager. There are listed the groups of users that HAVE rights (the unlisted do not have rights). If the list is empty, that means that there aren't any restrictions (any user can set the Layout for all users).

Here is a short explanation on access to WEB customization of Menu, Views, Panels and Forms depending on the User status.
