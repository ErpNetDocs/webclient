# How to use the Select by navigator option

Upon clicking a field that has Ð° drop down option menu, for example the Sales Person field in Sales, a three point button will visualize and open the drop down menu itself.

The **Select by navigator** option allows you to easily access all data related to a certain field by clicking just a few buttons. 

In this way, you can complete a form just by choosing from a list of options the one that contains exactly what you need. 

Once you confirm the selection of the needed data, it will be **automatically** filled on the main page. 

## Example use-case

1. To begin the process, choose a section from the menu (e.g. **CRM**).


2. From the sub-menu that appears underneath, click on a corresponding subsection (e.g. **Sales**).

 
3. We want to create a **direct sale order**. 


4. On the respective page, you can see one or more drop down fields. 

To access the **Select by navigator** option and the available features that come with it, click the **downward chevron** button.


5. A vertical three-point button will appear right above the chevron button.

 
6. By clicking on it, you expand a menu from which you can choose **Select by navigator**.

  
This takes you to a new page where you can see all of the field's available data. 

The navigator responsible for containing this type of data will be opened in **Select** **mode** - the button for selecting information will be visualized based on the option you select.

 
7. After choosing an option, click on the **Select** button which will match your choice. 

The button is located on the bottom right side of the page. If you make a change to the selected option, the button's text will reflect it.

 
8. After selecting and confirming your choice, you will return to the original form (e.g. **direct sales order**). 

The data you've selected will be filled in the respective drop down field.
