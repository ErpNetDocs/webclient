# How to use the Select by navigator option

Upon clicking a field that has Ð° drop down option menu, for example the Sales Person field in Sales, a three point button will visualize and open the drop down menu itself.

The **Select by navigator** option allows you to easily access all data related to a certain field by clicking just a few buttons. 

In this way, you can complete a form just by choosing from a list of options the one that contains exactly what you need. 

Once you confirm the selection of the needed data, it will be **automatically** filled on the main page. 

## Example use-case

1. To begin the process, choose a section from the menu (e.g. **CRM**) and then a subsection (e.g. **Sales**).

3. On the respective page, you can see one or more fields which can be filled manually or with the help of dropdown menus.

This takes you to a separate page where you can see all of the field's available data. 

The navigator responsible for containing it will be opened in **Select mode**.
